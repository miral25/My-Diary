You are close to having your car paid off and you total it, you are about to win a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.selfgrowth.com/sports.html">sports</a>&nbsp;competition and you get injured, you are about to take the trip of a life time and you get sick, you decide you purchase a new home and have other unexpected expenses, you are about to get a promotion but loose your nanny and want to stay home with the baby, you finally decide to scale down on the hours at the office and your assistant quits, your business is about to make it big and your partner pulls out, your body starts trimming and looking fit and you stop going to the gym and eating healthy, you get the drift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for this is that we scare ourselves off from getting what we want, moving forward with our life, achieving our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.selfgrowth.com/dreams.html">dreams</a>. We are afraid of the unknown. We know what to do and how to be in a mediocre life. We don&rsquo;t know what to do and how to be in an amazing life. We believe we don&rsquo;t deserve or we are not good enough for more. We believe we can&rsquo;t do better. We can&rsquo;t fathom a better life, never mind how to get there. So whenever we are close to a breakthrough we unconsciously sabotage it. We induce disasters, we shoot ourselves on the foot, we invite drama and chaos, anything to distract us from getting to our intended destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do the same in our relationship. Have you noticed that whenever you are getting along great, have been on the same page and feeling close, or are ready for the next level of commitment, that you have a major fight or experience a set back? It is too scary for our unconscious mind to be intimate, satisfied and happy. It is afraid that this too shall pass like it did when we were children. It sabotages attempts at closeness and satisfaction to protect itself from additional pain and disappointment. It creates conflict, space and disconnect. Even though these states hurt, they are what we know and hence easier to endure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, our unconscious mind is time, place and people stupid. It doesn&rsquo;t know you are in 2008, that your partner is your partner, and you are in your adult home. It believes your partner is your less-than-perfect-caretaker(s), back when you were young, in the home you grew up in. Imagine operating from that state and trying to create the life and relationship you want!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a conundrum this is. We work hard at having a great life and relationship, but are operating at a less than resourceful state and do anything possible to undermine ourselves. Talk about spinning our wheels!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can stop this ridiculous cycle and actually start creating and enjoying the life and relationship we want:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Soothe your unconscious mind by tending to its fear and reassuring it. Feel and name the feelings, put them in perspective, understand what triggered them and why. What do they remind you of growing up? Identify what the broken record in your head is saying and where it comes from. Soothe your self with understanding, acknowledgement and acceptance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Meet your global needs by making sure you get the antidote to your hurts from childhood. Translate the feelings and story you identified above into emotional needs and diligently go about having them met. By believing in yourself, doing for yourself, pampering, nurturing, and cherishing yourself. Ask for what you need from your partner and set them up to be able to give it to you. Once you do get what you asked for receive it, accept it, take it in!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Grow yourself up by becoming whole again. Become mindful of situations, events, and interactions that trigger you and your usual responses to them. Stretch yourself by activating a different more resourceful part of you to use to cope and respond. Try using more parts of you more frequently and consistently. Stretch yourself further by gifting your partner with what is usually difficult for you to give them. Integrate these into a grown up you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bestow your life, your relationship and your self with the care and attention of a grown up you. Don&rsquo;t sabotage, support yourself instead. Watch your life and relationship flourish! Live the life you want to live!!</p>\r\n', 'Stop Sabotaging Yourself!', 1, 0, '0'),

But this is actually okay, because I will never satisfy a woman, either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should I be writing such thoughts? Perhaps not. Perhaps it&#39;s a bad idea. I can definitely foresee a scenario where that first paragraph could come back to haunt me, especially if I somehow became marginally famous. If I become marginally famous, I will undoubtedly be interviewed by someone in the media, and the interviewer will inevitably ask, &quot;Fifteen years ago, you wrote that no woman could ever satisfy you. Now that you&#39;ve been married for almost five years, are those words still true?&quot; And I will have to say, &quot;Oh, God no. Those were the words of an entirely different person &mdash; a person whom I can&#39;t even relate to anymore. Honestly, I can&#39;t image an existence without _____. She satisfies me in ways that I never even considered. She saved my life, really.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I will be lying. I won&#39;t really feel that way. But I&#39;ll certainly&nbsp;<em>say</em>&nbsp;those words, and I&#39;ll deliver them with the utmost sincerity, even though those sentiments will not be there. So then the interviewer will undoubtedly quote lines from&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;particular paragraph, thereby reminding me that I swore I would publicly deny my true feelings, and I&#39;ll chuckle and say, &quot;Come on, Mr. Rose. That was a literary device. You know I never really believed that.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But here&#39;s the thing: I&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;believe that. It&#39;s the truth now, and it will be in the future. And while I&#39;m not exactly happy about that truth, it doesn&#39;t make me sad, either. I know it&#39;s not my fault.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s no one&#39;s fault, really. Or maybe it&#39;s everyone&#39;s fault. It should be everyone&#39;s fault, because it&#39;s everyone&#39;s problem. Well, okay...not&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>. Not boring people, and not the profoundly retarded. But whenever I meet dynamic, nonretarded Americans, I notice that they all seem to share a single unifying characteristic: the inability to experience the kind of mind-blowing, transcendent romantic relationship they perceive to be a normal part of living. And someone needs to take the fall for this. So instead of blaming no one for this (which is kind of cowardly) or blaming everyone (which is kind of meaningless), I&#39;m going to blame John Cusack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I once loved a girl who almost loved me, but not as much as she loved John Cusack. Under certain circumstances, this would have been fine; Cusack is relatively good-looking, he seems like a pretty cool guy (he likes the Clash and the Who, at least), and he undoubtedly has millions of bones in the bank. If Cusack and I were competing for the same woman, I could easily accept losing. However, I don&#39;t really feel like John and I were &quot;competing&quot; for the girl I&#39;m referring to, inasmuch as her relationship to Cusack was confined to watching him as a two-dimensional projection, pretending to be characters who don&#39;t actually exist. Now, there was a time when I would have thought that detachment would have given me a huge advantage over Johnny C., inasmuch as&nbsp;<em>my</em>&nbsp;relationship with this woman included things like &quot;talking on the phone&quot; and &quot;nuzzling under umbrellas&quot; and &quot;eating pancakes.&quot; However, I have come to realize that I perceived this competition completely backward; it was definitely an unfair battle, but not in my favor. It was unfair in Cusack&#39;s favor. I never had a chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears that countless women born between the years of 1965 and 1978 are in love with John Cusack. I cannot fathom how he isn&#39;t the number-one box-office star in America, because every straight girl I know would sell her soul to share a milkshake with that motherfucker. For upwardly mobile women in their twenties and thirties, John Cusack is the neo-Elvis. But here&#39;s what none of these upwardly mobile women seem to realize: They don&#39;t love John Cusack. They love Lloyd Dobler. When they see Mr. Cusack, they are still seeing the optimistic, charmingly loquacious teenager he played in&nbsp;<em>Say Anything</em>, a movie that came out more than a decade ago. That&#39;s the guy they think he is; when Cusack played Eddie Thomas in&nbsp;<em>America&#39;s Sweethearts</em>&nbsp;or the sensitive hit man in&nbsp;<em>Grosse Pointe Blank</em>, all his female fans knew he was only acting...but they assume when the camera stopped rolling, he went back to his genuine self...which was someone like Lloyd Dobler...which was, in fact, someone who&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Lloyd Dobler, and someone who continues to have a storybook romance with Diane Court (or with Ione Skye, depending on how you look at it). And these upwardly mobile women are not alone. We all convince ourselves of things like this &mdash; not necessarily about&nbsp;<em>Say Anything</em>, but about any fictionalized portrayals of romance that happen to hit us in the right place, at the right time. This is why I will never be completely satisfied by a woman, and this is why the kind of woman I tend to find attractive will never be satisfied by me. We will both measure our relationship against the prospect of fake love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fake love is a very powerful thing. That girl who adored John Cusack once had the opportunity to spend a weekend with me in New York at the Waldorf-Astoria, but she elected to fly to Portland instead to see the first U.S. appearance by Coldplay, a British pop group whose success derives from their ability to write melodramatic alt-rock songs about fake love. It does not matter that Coldplay is absolutely the shittiest fucking band I&#39;ve ever heard in my entire fucking life, or that they sound like a mediocre photocopy of Travis (who sound like a mediocre photocopy of Radiohead), or that their greatest fucking artistic achievement is a video where their blandly attractive frontman walks on a beach on a cloudy fucking afternoon. None of that matters. What matters is that Coldplay manufactures fake love as frenetically as the Ford fucking Motor Company manufactures Mustangs, and that&#39;s all this woman heard. &quot;For you I bleed myself dry,&quot; sang their blockhead vocalist, brilliantly informing us that stars in the sky are, in fact, yellow. How am I going to compete with that shit? That sleepy-eyed bozo isn&#39;t even making sense. He&#39;s just pouring fabricated emotions over four gloomy guitar chords, and it ends up sounding like love. And what does that mean? It means she flies to fucking Portland to hear two hours of amateurish U.K. hyper-slop, and I sleep alone in a $270 hotel in Manhattan, and I hope Coldplay gets fucking dropped by fucking EMI and ends up like the Stone fucking Roses, who were actually a better fucking band, all things considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that I&#39;m bitter about this. Oh, I concede that I may be taking this particular example somewhat personally &mdash; but I do think it&#39;s a perfect illustration of why almost everyone I know is either overtly or covertly unhappy. Coldplay songs deliver an amorphous, irrefutable interpretation of how being in love is supposed to feel, and people find themselves wanting that feeling for real. They want men to adore them like Lloyd Dobler would, and they want women to think like Aimee Mann, and they expect all their arguments to sound like Sam Malone and Diane Chambers. They think everything will work out perfectly in the end (just like it did for Helen Fielding&#39;s Bridget Jones and Nick Hornby&#39;s Rob Fleming), and they don&#39;t stop believing, because Journey&#39;s Steve Perry insists we should never do that. In the nineteenth century, teenagers merely aspired to have a marriage that would be better than that of their parents; personally, I would never be satisfied unless my marriage was as good as Cliff and Clair Huxtable&#39;s (or at least as enigmatic as Jack and Meg White&#39;s).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pundits are always blaming TV for making people stupid, movies for desensitizing the world to violence, and rock music for making kids take drugs and kill themselves. These things should be the least of our worries. The main problem with mass media is that it makes it impossible to fall in love with any acumen of normalcy. There is no &quot;normal,&quot; because everybody is being twisted by the same sources simultaneously. You can&#39;t compare your relationship with the playful couple who lives next door, because they&#39;re probably modeling themselves after Chandler Bing and Monica Geller. Real people are actively trying to live like fake people, so real people are no less fake. Every comparison becomes impractical. This is why the impractical has become totally acceptable; impracticality almost seems cool. The best relationship I ever had was with a journalist who was as crazy as me, and some of our coworkers liked to compare us to Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen. At the time, I used to think, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s completely valid: We fight all the time, our love is self-destructive, and &mdash; if she was mysteriously killed &mdash; I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be wrongly arrested for second-degree murder before dying from an overdose.&quot; We even watched&nbsp;<em>Sid &amp; Nancy</em>&nbsp;in her parents&#39; basement and giggled the whole time. &quot;That&#39;s us,&quot; we said gleefully. And like I said &mdash; this was the&nbsp;<em>best</em>&nbsp;relationship I ever had. And I suspect it was the best one she ever had, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, this media transference is not all bad. It has certainly worked to my advantage, just as it has for all modern men who look and talk and act like me. We all owe our lives to Woody Allen. If Woody Allen had never been born, I&#39;m sure I would be doomed to a life of celibacy. Remember the aforementioned woman who loved Cusack and Coldplay? There is absolutely no way I could have dated this person if Woody Allen didn&#39;t exist. In tangible terms, she was light-years out of my league, along with most of the other women I&#39;ve slept with. But Woody Allen changed everything. Woody Allen made it acceptable for beautiful women to sleep with nerdy, bespectacled goofballs; all we need to do is fabricate the illusion of intellectual humor, and we somehow have a chance. The irony is that many of the women most susceptible to this scam haven&#39;t even&nbsp;<em>seen</em>&nbsp;any of Woody&#39;s movies, nor would they want to touch the actual Woody Allen if they ever had the chance (especially since he&#39;s proven to be an&nbsp;<em>&uuml;ber</em>-pervy clarinet freak). If asked, most of these foxy ladies wouldn&#39;t classify Woody Allen as sexy, or handsome, or even likable. But this is how media devolution works: It creates an archetype that eventually dwarfs its origin. By now, the &quot;Woody Allen Personality Type&quot; has far greater cultural importance than the man himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the argument could be made that all this is good for the sexual bloodstream of Americana, and that all these Women Who Want Woody are being unconsciously conditioned to be less shallow than their sociobiology dictates. Self-deprecating cleverness has become a virtue. At least on the surface, movies and television actively promote dating the nonbeautiful: If we have learned anything from the mass media, it&#39;s that the only people who can make us happy are those who don&#39;t strike us as being particularly desirable. Whether it&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Jerry Maguire</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Sixteen Candles</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Who&#39;s the Boss</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Some Kind of Wonderful</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Speed Racer</em>, we are constantly reminded that the unattainable icons of perfection we lust after can never fulfill us like the platonic allies who have been there all along. If we all took media messages at their absolute face value, we&#39;d all be sleeping with our best friends. And that does happen, sometimes. But herein lies the trap: We&#39;ve also been trained to think this will<em>always</em>&nbsp;work out over the long term, which dooms us to disappointment. Because when push comes to shove, we really&nbsp;<em>don&#39;t</em>&nbsp;want to have sex with our friends...unless they&#39;re sexy. And sometimes we&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;want to have sex with our blackhearted, soul-sucking enemies...assuming&nbsp;<em>they&#39;re</em>&nbsp;sexy. Because that&#39;s all it ever comes down to in real life, regardless of what happened to Michael J. Fox in&nbsp;<em>Teen Wolf</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mass media causes sexual misdirection: It prompts us to&nbsp;<em>need</em>&nbsp;something deeper than what we&nbsp;<em>want</em>. This is why Woody Allen has made nebbish guys cool; he makes people assume there is something profound about having a relationship based on witty conversation and intellectual discourse. There isn&#39;t. It&#39;s just another gimmick, and it&#39;s no different than wanting to be with someone because they&#39;re thin or rich or the former lead singer of Whiskeytown. And it actually might be worse, because an intellectual relationship isn&#39;t real&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. My witty banter and cerebral discourse is always completely contrived. Right now, I have three and a half dates worth of material, all of which I pretend to deliver spontaneously. This is my strategy: If I can just coerce women into the last half of that fourth date, it&#39;s anyone&#39;s ball game. I&#39;ve beaten the system; I&#39;ve broken the code; I&#39;ve slain the Minotaur. If we part ways on that fourth evening without some kind of conversational disaster, she probably digs me. Or at least she&nbsp;<em>thinks</em>&nbsp;she digs me, because who she digs is not really me. Sadly, our relationship will not last ninety-three minutes (like&nbsp;<em>Annie Hall</em>) or ninety-six minutes (like&nbsp;<em>Manhattan</em>). It will go on for days or weeks or months or years, and I&#39;ve already used everything in my vault. Very soon, I will have nothing more to say, and we will be sitting across from each other at breakfast, completely devoid of banter; she will feel betrayed and foolish, and I will suddenly find myself actively trying to avoid spending time with a woman I didn&#39;t deserve to be with in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps this sounds depressing. That is not my intention. This is all normal. There&#39;s not a lot to say during breakfast. I mean, you just woke up, you know? Nothing has happened. If neither person had an especially weird dream and nobody burned the toast, breakfast is just the time for chewing Cocoa Puffs and/or wishing you were still asleep. But we&#39;ve been convinced not to think like that. Silence is only supposed to happen as a manifestation of supreme actualization, where both parties are so at peace with their emotional connection that it cannot be expressed through the rudimentary tools of the lexicon; otherwise, silence is proof that the magic is gone and the relationship is over (hence the phrase &quot;We just don&#39;t talk anymore&quot;). For those of us who grew up in the media age, the only good silence is the kind described by the hair metal band Extreme. &quot;More than words is all I ever needed you to show,&quot; explained Gary Cherone on the&nbsp;<em>Pornograffiti</em>&nbsp;album. &quot;Then you wouldn&#39;t have to say that you love me, cause I&#39;d already know.&quot; This is the difference between art and life: In art, not talking is never an extension of having nothing to say; not talking always means something. And now that art and life have become completely interchangeable, we&#39;re forced to live inside the acoustic power chords of Nuno Bettencourt, even if most of us don&#39;t necessarily know who the fuck Nuno Bettencourt is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>When Harry Met Sally&nbsp;</em>hit theaters in 1989. I didn&#39;t see it until 1997, but it turns out I could have skipped it entirely. The movie itself isn&#39;t bad (which is pretty amazing, since it stars Meg Ryan&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;Billy Crystal), and there are funny parts and sweet parts and smart dialogue, and &mdash; all things considered &mdash; it&#39;s a well-executed example of a certain kind of entertainment. Yet watching this film in 1997 was like watching the 1978 one-game playoff between the Yankees and the Red Sox on&nbsp;<em>ESPN Classic</em>: Though I&#39;ve never sat through the pitch sequence that leads to Bucky Dent&#39;s three-run homer, I know exactly what happened. I feel like I remember it, even though I don&#39;t. And &mdash; more important &mdash;&nbsp;<em>I know what it all means</em>. Knowing about sports means knowing that Bucky Dent is the living, breathing, metaphorical incarnation of the Bo Sox&#39;s undying futility; I didn&#39;t have to see that game to understand the fabric of its existence. I didn&#39;t need to see&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally</em>, either. Within three years of its initial release, classifying any intense friendship as &quot;totally a&nbsp;<em>Harry-Met-Sally</em>&nbsp;situation&quot; had a recognizable meaning to everyone, regardless of whether or not they&#39;d actually seen the movie. And that meaning remains clear and remarkably consistent: It implies that two platonic acquaintances are refusing to admit that they&#39;re deeply in love with each other.&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally</em>&nbsp;cemented the plausibility of that notion, and it gave a lot of desperate people hope. It made it realistic to suspect your best friend may be your soul mate, and it made wanting such a scenario comfortably conventional. The problem is that the&nbsp;<em>Harry-Met-Sally</em>&nbsp;situation is almost always tragically unbalanced. Most of the time, the two involved parties are not really &quot;best friends.&quot; Inevitably, one of the people has been in love with the other from the first day they met, while the other person is either (a) wracked with guilt and pressure, or (b) completely oblivious to the espoused attraction. Every relationship is fundamentally a power struggle, and the individual in power is whoever likes the other person less. But&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally</em>&nbsp;gives the powerless, unrequited lover a reason to live. When this person gets drunk and tells his friends that he&#39;s in love with a woman who only sees him as a buddy, they will say, &quot;You&#39;re wrong. You&#39;re perfect for each other. This is just like&nbsp;<em>When Harry Met Sally</em>! I&#39;m sure she loves you &mdash; she just doesn&#39;t realize it yet.&quot; Nora Ephron accidentally ruined a lot of lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember taking a course in college called &quot;Communication and Society,&quot; and my professor was obsessed by the belief that fairy tales like &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; and &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; were evil. She said they were part of a latent social code that hoped to suppress women and minorities. At the time, I was mildly outraged that my tuition money was supporting this kind of crap; years later, I have come to recall those pseudo-savvy lectures as what I&nbsp;<em>loved</em>&nbsp;about college. But I still think they were probably wasteful, and here&#39;s why: Even if those theories are true, they&#39;re barely significant. &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; is not the story that is fucking people up. Stories like<em>Say Anything</em>&nbsp;are fucking people up. We don&#39;t need to worry about people unconsciously &quot;absorbing&quot; archaic secret messages when they&#39;re six years old; we need to worry about all the entertaining messages people are consciously accepting when they&#39;re twenty-six. They&#39;re the ones that get us, because they&#39;re the ones we try to turn into life. I mean, Christ: I wish I could believe that bozo in Coldplay when he tells me that stars are yellow. I miss that girl. I wish I was Lloyd Dobler. I don&#39;t want anybody to step on a piece of broken glass. I want fake love. But that&#39;s all I want, and that&#39;s why I can&#39;t have it.</p>\r\n', 'Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs', 0, 1, '0'),
('sunnygkp10@gmail.com', '551389197da96', '2015-03-26', '05:20:41am', '<p>One beautiful April morning, on a narrow side street in Tokyo&rsquo;s fashionable Harujuku neighborhood, I walked past the 100% perfect girl.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTell you the truth, she&rsquo;s not that good-looking. She doesn&rsquo;t stand out in any way. Her clothes are nothing special. The back of her hair is still bent out of shape from sleep. She isn&rsquo;t young, either - must be near thirty, not even close to a &ldquo;girl,&rdquo; properly speaking. But still, I know from fifty yards away: She&rsquo;s the 100% perfect girl for me. The moment I see her, there&rsquo;s a rumbling in my chest, and my mouth is as dry as a desert.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe you have your own particular favorite type of girl - one with slim ankles, say, or big eyes, or graceful fingers, or you&rsquo;re drawn for no good reason to girls who take their time with every meal. I have my own preferences, of course. Sometimes in a restaurant I&rsquo;ll catch myself staring at the girl at the next table to mine because I like the shape of her nose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut no one can insist that his 100% perfect girl correspond to some preconceived type. Much as I like noses, I can&rsquo;t recall the shape of hers - or even if she had one. All I can remember for sure is that she was no great beauty. It&rsquo;s weird.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Yesterday on the street I passed the 100% girl,&rdquo; I tell someone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Good-looking?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Your favorite type, then?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t seem to remember anything about her - the shape of her eyes or the size of her breasts.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Strange.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Yeah. Strange.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;So anyhow,&rdquo; he says, already bored, &ldquo;what did you do? Talk to her? Follow her?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Nah. Just passed her on the street.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe&rsquo;s walking east to west, and I west to east. It&rsquo;s a really nice April morning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWish I could talk to her. Half an hour would be plenty: just ask her about herself, tell her about myself, and - what I&rsquo;d really like to do - explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981. This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock build when peace filled the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter talking, we&rsquo;d have lunch somewhere, maybe see a Woody Allen movie, stop by a hotel bar for cocktails. With any kind of luck, we might end up in bed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPotentiality knocks on the door of my heart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow the distance between us has narrowed to fifteen yards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow can I approach her? What should I say?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Good morning, miss. Do you think you could spare half an hour for a little conversation?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRidiculous. I&rsquo;d sound like an insurance salesman.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Pardon me, but would you happen to know if there is an all-night cleaners in the neighborhood?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo, this is just as ridiculous. I&rsquo;m not carrying any laundry, for one thing. Who&rsquo;s going to buy a line like that?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaybe the simple truth would do. &ldquo;Good morning. You are the 100% perfect girl for me.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNo, she wouldn&rsquo;t believe it. Or even if she did, she might not want to talk to me. Sorry, she could say, I might be the 100% perfect girl for you, but you&rsquo;re not the 100% boy for me. It could happen. And if I found myself in that situation, I&rsquo;d probably go to pieces. I&rsquo;d never recover from the shock. I&rsquo;m thirty-two, and that&rsquo;s what growing older is all about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe pass in front of a flower shop. A small, warm air mass touches my skin. The asphalt is damp, and I catch the scent of roses. I can&rsquo;t bring myself to speak to her. She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp white envelope lacking only a stamp. So: She&rsquo;s written somebody a letter, maybe spent the whole night writing, to judge from the sleepy look in her eyes. The envelope could contain every secret she&rsquo;s ever had.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI take a few more strides and turn: She&rsquo;s lost in the crowd.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, of course, I know exactly what I should have said to her. It would have been a long speech, though, far too long for me to have delivered it properly. The ideas I come up with are never very practical.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOh, well. It would have started &ldquo;Once upon a time&rdquo; and ended &ldquo;A sad story, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce upon a time, there lived a boy and a girl. The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;This is amazing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you&rsquo;re the 100% perfect girl for me.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;are the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I&rsquo;d pictured you in every detail. It&rsquo;s like a dream.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It&rsquo;s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one&rsquo;s dreams to come true so easily?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s test ourselves - just once. If we really are each other&rsquo;s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we&rsquo;ll marry then and there. What do you think?&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that is exactly what we should do.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other&rsquo;s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season&rsquo;s terrible inluenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence&rsquo;s piggy bank.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTime passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, but along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in their chest. And they knew:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe is the 100% perfect girl for me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe is the 100% perfect boy for me.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fouteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA sad story, don&rsquo;t you think?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes, that&rsquo;s it, that is what I should have said to her.</p>\r\n', 'ON SEEING THE 100% PERFECT GIRL ONE BEAUTIFUL APRIL MORNING', 1, 1, '0'),

Love what you do.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The command is framed and perched in a living room that can only be described as &ldquo;well-curated.&rdquo; A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2013/04/sneak-peek-jessica-walsh.html" target="_blank">picture of this room appeared first on a popular design blog</a>&nbsp;and has been pinned, tumbl&rsquo;d, and liked thousands of times. Though it introduces exhortations to labor into a space of leisure, the &ldquo;do what you love&rdquo; living room is the place all those pinners and likers long to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s little doubt that &ldquo;do what you love&rdquo; (DWYL) is now the unofficial work mantra for our time. The problem with DWYL, however, is that it leads not to salvation but to the devaluation of actual work&mdash;and more importantly, the dehumanization of the vast majority of laborers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Superficially, DWYL is an uplifting piece of advice, urging us to ponder what it is we most enjoy doing and then turn that activity into a wage-generating enterprise. But why should our pleasure be for profit? And who is the audience for this dictum?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DWYL is a secret handshake of the privileged and a worldview that disguises its elitism as noble self-betterment. According to this way of thinking, labor is not something one does for compensation but is an act of love. If profit doesn&rsquo;t happen to follow, presumably it is because the worker&rsquo;s passion and determination were insufficient. Its real achievement is making workers believe their labor serves the self and not the marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aphorisms usually have numerous origins and reincarnations, but the nature of DWYL confounds precise attribution.&nbsp;<em>Oxford Reference</em>&nbsp;links the phrase and variants of it to Martina Navratilova and Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais, among others. The Internet frequently attributes it to Confucius, locating it in a misty, orientalized past. Oprah Winfrey and other peddlers of positivity have included the notion in their repertoires for decades. Even the world of finance has gotten in on DWYL: &ldquo;If you love what you do, it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;work,&rsquo;&rdquo; as&nbsp;the co-CEO&nbsp;of the private equity firm Carlyle Group&nbsp;<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/wall-street-work-habits-show-generation-gap/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;partner=socialflow&amp;smid=tw-nytimesbusiness&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">put it to CNBC this week</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important recent evangelist of DWYL, however, was the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs. In his graduation speech to the Stanford University Class of 2005, Jobs recounted the creation of Apple and inserted this reflection:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>You&rsquo;ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In these four sentences, the words &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; appear eight times. This focus on the individual isn&rsquo;t surprising coming from Jobs, who cultivated a very specific image of himself as a worker: inspired, casual, passionate&mdash;all states agreeable with ideal romantic love. Jobs conflated his besotted worker-self with his company so effectively that his black turtleneck and jeans became metonyms for all of Apple and the labor that maintains it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Steve Jobs" src="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/technology/2014/01/140116_TECH_SteveJobsTurtleneck.jpg.CROP.promo-mediumlarge.jpg" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do what you love. Wear what you love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by portraying Apple as a labor of his individual love, Jobs elided the labor of untold thousands in Apple&rsquo;s factories, hidden from sight on the other side of the planet&mdash;the very labor that allowed Jobs to actualize his love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This erasure needs to be exposed. While DWYL seems harmless and precious, it is self-focused to the point of narcissism. Jobs&rsquo; formulation of DWYL is the depressing antithesis to Henry David Thoreau&rsquo;s utopian vision of labor for all. In &ldquo;Life Without Principle,&rdquo; Thoreau wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&hellip;&#8198;it would be good economy for a town to pay its laborers so well that they would not feel that they were working for low ends, as for a livelihood merely, but for scientific, even moral ends. Do not hire a man who does your work for money, but him who does it for the love of it.&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, Thoreau had little feel for the proletariat. (It&rsquo;s hard to imagine someone washing diapers for &ldquo;scientific, even moral ends,&rdquo; no matter how well paid.) But he nonetheless maintains that society has a stake in making work well compensated and meaningful. By contrast, the 21st-century Jobsian view asks us to turn inward. It absolves us of any obligation to, or acknowledgment of, the wider world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One consequence of this isolation is the division that DWYL creates among workers, largely along class lines. Work becomes divided into two opposing classes: that which is lovable (creative, intellectual, socially prestigious) and that which is not (repetitive, unintellectual, undistinguished). Those in the lovable-work camp are vastly more privileged in terms of wealth, social status, education, society&rsquo;s racial biases, and political clout, while comprising a small minority of the workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In ignoring most work and reclassifying the rest as love, DWYL may be the most elegant anti-worker ideology around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo by Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those forced into unlovable work, it&rsquo;s a different story. Under the DWYL credo, labor that is done out of motives or needs other than love&mdash;which is, in fact, most labor&mdash;is erased. As in Jobs&rsquo; Stanford speech, unlovable but socially necessary work is banished from our consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of the great variety of work that allowed Jobs to spend even one day as CEO. His food harvested from fields, then transported across great distances. His company&rsquo;s goods assembled, packaged, shipped. Apple advertisements scripted, cast, filmed. Lawsuits processed. Office wastebaskets emptied and ink cartridges filled. Job creation goes both ways. Yet with the vast majority of workers effectively invisible to elites busy in their lovable occupations, how can it be surprising that the heavy strains faced by today&rsquo;s workers&mdash;abysmal wages, massive child care costs, etc.&mdash;barely register as political issues even among the liberal faction of the ruling class?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In ignoring most work and reclassifying the rest as love, DWYL may be the most elegant anti-worker ideology around. Why should workers assemble and assert their class interests if there&rsquo;s no such thing as work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* * *</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Do what you love&rdquo; disguises the fact that being able to choose a career primarily for personal reward is a privilege, a sign of socioeconomic class. Even if a self-employed graphic designer had parents who could pay for art school and co-sign a lease for a slick Brooklyn apartment, she can bestow DWYL as career advice upon those covetous of her success.</p>\r\n', 'In the Name of Love', 0, 1, '0');

It was one of those wonderfully solemn sociological papers in which the utterly self-evident is systematically recast as the cautiously empirical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authors point out early on in their report that &quot;social psychological research suggests that attractive people are favoured in numerous situations&quot; (a thing you would not have guessed without social science) and soon after we learn that attractive and physically fit men report going on more dates and having sex more frequently than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the conclusion of the paper, once one has weeded through, is striking and well documented. It is simply that short men make stable marriages. They do this in circumstances of difficulty and against the odds and consistently over ages and income groups, and they do it with the shorter women they often marry, but also with the taller women they sometimes land. Short men marry late but, once they do get married, tend to stay married longer and, by social science measures, at least - I assume this means they ask the short men&#39;s wives (I hope so anyway) - they stay happily married, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style="font-style:inherit">&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many assertions about the assortative can be put forward to explain why this is so, but trust me, it is not hard to figure it out. There is a simple reason short men make stable marriages. It is because short men are desperate. Short men live in a world of taller men and know that any advantage seized is better kept. Desperation makes short men good husbands. We know the odds instinctively, and knowing that we have lucked out, intend to continue playing a good thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not, I should rush to add, that short men are desperate to please. One of the most interesting findings of the study is that short men actually do less housework in a typical marriage than tall men do - though the study points out delicately, this may be because with tall men, &quot;the nature of their housework is different&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, we are too short to reach the tops of closets where the heavy house cleaning equipment is kept. No, short men do not make stable marriages because they are desperate to please. It is because they are desperate to prevail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An instinctive sense of the odds, born in schoolyards and playgrounds, tells the short man to redouble his efforts in every area of life - the office, the motorway, (God forbid) the golf course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is of course called the Napoleonic complex, but in truth it is not so much that short men become Napoleonic as that Napoleon was typically short - in his ambition, his drive, his uxorious devotion to his wife Josephine, whom he left only because he wanted to leave the French with a male heir. Hers was the last name on his lips, in the last sentences that he uttered, dreaming of that old stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="line" src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/625/media/images/74982000/jpg/_74982321_line976.jpg" style="height:auto; margin:0px; width:616.203125px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How tall was Napoleon?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Statue of Napoleon, Paris" src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/625/media/images/77984000/jpg/_77984282_napoleon-statue.jpg" style="height:auto; margin:0px; width:616.203125px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary accounts state that Bonaparte&#39;s height was 5ft 2in, but at that time, the French measured 13 inches to the foot (Napoleon himself oversaw France&#39;s conversion to the metric system). Given this discrepancy, Napoleon&#39;s height would have been 67 inches, or 5ft 7in in modern measurements - about the same height as the current French president, Francois Hollande, and taller than his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="line" src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/625/media/images/74982000/jpg/_74982321_line976.jpg" style="height:auto; margin:0px; width:616.203125px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is, I think, a broader moral here. In every area of life, we underrate the merits of desperation, and persistently overrate the advantages of free choice. We insist that we ought to all be equal, free to make the choices we want and find the partners we need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, people who have this kind of freedom rarely use it well. Fashion models, free to choose, inevitably choose rock stars - and since rock stars, freed by their glamour to choose, invariably choose to take a lot of drugs and go on the road and smash up hotel rooms in preference to being in a stable relationship, the models are always badly disappointed by their choice. You see them crying on the shoulders of the short men - dipping their long swan-like necks way down to do so, perhaps, but there you are, they do. Frequent failure is the true price of free choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="John and Sally Bercow" src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/625/media/images/77987000/jpg/_77987374_john-and-sally-bercow.jpg" style="height:auto; margin:0px; width:616.203125px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, and his wife Sally</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we look up - or rather down, even below the knees of the short, to the ground itself, we find this same truth embodied as an economic principle, where it is called the curse of resources. Countries with vast natural resources, such as oil and copper and gold, tend to do less well economically than countries that have none - the short people countries, in other words. This is because resources, easily found, are easily squandered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries and city-states with few or no resources - the short lands, one might call them - must rely on their ingenuity and effort, as Singapore and Switzerland do. They end up being more productive despite - indeed, because - they have so much less to work with. They have made, so to speak, stable marriages with the planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Angus Young" src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/625/media/images/77984000/jpg/_77984280_angus.jpg" style="height:auto; margin:0px; width:616.203125px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, what of short rock stars? I have been hearing you asking that question for the past two paragraphs. Don&#39;t they make unstable supermodel marriages? Isn&#39;t it really a question more of status than simple stature?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, first of all - are there short rock stars? An online list of short rock stars turns up people like Angus Young of AC/DC and Flea - but surely these are 2nd or 3rd XI rock stars? A rock star nicknamed Sting is a rock star. A rock star nicknamed Flea is not really a rock star. Angus Young, yes, is certainly a star - but a rock star of a very self-consciously short kind, famous, as we all know, for wearing schoolboy outfits onstage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this way indeed, short men (including short rock stars) in their desperation, shrewdly piggyback on one of the few human predispositions that I think can actually be called hardwired - what we might call the neotenic illusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By this I mean our readiness to think that anything that has the short stature and plump cheeks and rounded body of a human baby must actually be like a human baby. If we did not think babies were hopelessly cute, after all, we would kill them for being so exhausting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so panda bears and chipmunks, and short men too, have smuggled their way into our affections through the same cognitive door that was meant to open only for the infants. A typical penguin is as full of rage, violence and dignity as a tiger but they resemble our young, and so are pinned as adorable. They are classified as cute, as short men are, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Penguins" src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/625/media/images/77984000/jpg/_77984281_penguins.jpg" style="height:auto; margin:0px; width:616.203125px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full of rage, violence and dignity</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there is another, more easily overlooked truth that short people know that resource-short countries don&#39;t. The concept of shortness among men at least is surprisingly elastic. There is a period in the life of a short man - between his early adolescent unhappiness at being short, and his later awakening to the miracle of having achieved so much despite it - when his own shortness becomes invisible to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With our suits hemmed and altered, the waist cinched in by a painfully sympathetic tailor, we give the same appearance, in a mirror at least, with no comparison (I almost wrote &quot;no competition&quot;) around, of being about the same as anyone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the prime of a short man&#39;s life - Napoleon is the model here again - his shortness is not thematised at all. On horseback in the paintings by David or the Baron Gros, or enthroned by Ingres, Napoleon may look moon-faced, and the little ringlet that dangles above his eye may seem dandyish, but the last thing he looks is short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is only later on Elba and St Helena that his diminutive stature becomes part of his self-knowledge. The true Napoleonic moment is when age and circumstances conspire to remind the short man of his stature. It was when the emperor had lost the last battle that the truth returned. I am no longer an emperor. I am merely a short man on a lonely island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Rod Stewart and Penny Lancaster" src="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/625/media/images/77987000/jpg/_77987375_rod-stewart-and-penny-lanca.jpg" style="height:auto; margin:0px; width:616.203125px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rod Stewart and Penny Lancaster</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, short men learn early this essential truth - that long odds make for good lives. A man&#39;s mate should exceed his height, not to mention his little grasp, or what&#39;s a heaven for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not an accident, I think, that the great periods of civilisation tend to follow on and then appear not in moments of abundance alone, but of renewed relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They come shortly after some disaster that has given an entire community the same sense of having made it by the skin of their teeth that a short man feels, looking gratefully at his wife in the early morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renaissance Florence appeared in the wake of the black plague that halved its population. The Paris we love most, that of the impressionists and the Belle Epoque, rose with the smouldering ruins of the Franco-Prussian war still visible in its centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were reduced - shortened, one might even say - but they clung to pleasure.

It was winter, freezing, the trees encased in ice and a few lone blackbirds balancing on telephone wires. We were in our early 30s, considered ourselves hip and cynical, the types who decried the institution of marriage even as we sought its status. During our wedding brunch we put out a big suggestion box and asked people to slip us advice on how to avoid divorce; we thought it was a funny, clear-eyed, grounded sort of thing to do, although the suggestions were mostly foolish: Screw the toothpaste cap on tight. After the guests left, the house got quiet. There were flowers everywhere: puckered red roses and fragile ferns. &ldquo;What can we do that&rsquo;s really romantic?&rdquo; I asked my newly wed one. Benjamin suggested we take a bath. I didn&rsquo;t want a bath. He suggested a lunch of chilled white wine and salmon. I was sick of salmon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What can we do that&rsquo;s really romantic?</em>&nbsp;The wedding was over, the silence seemed suffocating, and I felt the familiar disappointment after a longed-for event has come and gone. We were married. Hip, hip, hooray. I decided to take a walk. I went into the center of town, pressed my nose against a bakery window, watched the man with flour on his hands, the dough as soft as skin, pushed and pulled and shaped at last into stars. I milled about in an antique store. At last I came to our town&rsquo;s tattoo parlor. Now I am not a tattoo type person, but for some reason, on that cold silent Sunday, I decided to walk in. &ldquo;Can I help you?&rdquo; a woman asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Is there a kind of tattoo I can get that won&rsquo;t be permanent?&rdquo; I asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Henna tattoos,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She explained that they lasted for six weeks, were used at Indian weddings, were stark and beautiful and all brown. She showed me pictures of Indian women with jewels in their noses, their arms scrolled and laced with the henna markings. Indeed they were beautiful, sharing none of the gaudy comic strip quality of the tattoos we see in the United States. These henna tattoos spoke of intricacy, of the webwork between two people, of ties that bind and how difficult it is to find their beginnings and their ends. And because I had just gotten married, and because I was feeling a post wedding letdown, and because I wanted something really romantic to sail me through the night, I decided to get one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; I said. I laid my hands over my breasts and belly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am a modest person. But I took off my shirt, lay on the table, heard her in the back room mixing powders and paints. She came to me carrying a small black-bellied pot inside of which was a rich red mush, slightly glittering. She adorned me. She gave me vines and flowers. She turned my body into a stake supporting whole new gardens of growth, and then, low around my hips, she painted a delicate chain-linked chastity belt. An hour later, the paint dry, I put my clothes back on, went home to find my newly wed one. This, I knew, was my gift to him, the kind of present you offer only once in your lifetime. I let him undress me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he said, standing back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I blushed, and we began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are no longer beginning, my husband and I. This does not surprise me. Even back then, wearing the decor of desire, the serpentining tattoos, I knew they would fade, their red-clay color bleaching out until they were gone. On my wedding day I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do now. Eight years later, pale as a pillowcase, here I sit, with all the extra pounds and baggage time brings. And the questions have only grown more insistent. Does passion necessarily diminish over time? How reliable is romantic love, really, as a means of choosing one&rsquo;s mate? Can a marriage be good when Eros is replaced with friendship, or even economic partnership, two people bound by bank accounts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me be clear: I still love my husband. There is no man I desire more. But it&rsquo;s hard to sustain romance in the crumb-filled quotidian that has become our lives. The ties that bind have been frayed by money and mortgages and children, those little imps who somehow manage to tighten the knot while weakening its actual fibers. Benjamin and I have no time for chilled white wine and salmon. The baths in our house always include Big Bird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this all sounds miserable, it isn&rsquo;t. My marriage is like a piece of comfortable clothing; even the arguments have a feel of fuzziness to them, something so familiar it can only be called home. And yet...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Western world we have for centuries concocted poems and stories and plays about the cycles of love, the way it morphs and changes over time, the way passion grabs us by our flung-back throats and then leaves us for something saner. If&nbsp;<em>Dracula</em>&mdash;the frail woman, the sensuality of submission&mdash;reflects how we understand the passion of early romance, the&nbsp;<em>Flintstones</em>&nbsp;reflects our experiences of long-term love: All is gravel and somewhat silly, the song so familiar you can&rsquo;t stop singing it, and when you do, the emptiness is almost unbearable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have relied on stories to explain the complexities of love, tales of jealous gods and arrows. Now, however, these stories&mdash;so much a part of every civilization&mdash;may be changing as science steps in to explain what we have always felt to be myth, to be magic. For the first time, new research has begun to illuminate where love lies in the brain, the particulars of its chemical components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anthropologist Helen Fisher may be the closest we&rsquo;ve ever come to having a doyenne of desire. At 60 she exudes a sexy confidence, with corn-colored hair, soft as floss, and a willowy build. A professor at Rutgers University, she lives in New York City, her book-lined apartment near Central Park, with its green trees fluffed out in the summer season, its paths crowded with couples holding hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fisher has devoted much of her career to studying the biochemical pathways of love in all its manifestations: lust, romance, attachment, the way they wax and wane. One leg casually crossed over the other, ice clinking in her glass, she speaks with appealing frankness, discussing the ups and downs of love the way most people talk about real estate. &ldquo;A woman unconsciously uses orgasms as a way of deciding whether or not a man is good for her. If he&rsquo;s impatient and rough, and she doesn&rsquo;t have the orgasm, she may instinctively feel he&rsquo;s less likely to be a good husband and father. Scientists think the fickle female orgasm may have evolved to help women distinguish Mr. Right from Mr. Wrong.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Fisher&rsquo;s central pursuits in the past decade has been looking at love, quite literally, with the aid of an MRI machine. Fisher and her colleagues Arthur Aron and Lucy Brown recruited subjects who had been &ldquo;madly in love&rdquo; for an average of seven months. Once inside the MRI machine, subjects were shown two photographs, one neutral, the other of their loved one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Fisher saw fascinated her. When each subject looked at his or her loved one, the parts of the brain linked to reward and pleasure&mdash;the ventral tegmental area and the caudate nucleus&mdash;lit up. What excited Fisher most was not so much finding a location, an address, for love as tracing its specific chemical pathways. Love lights up the caudate nucleus because it is home to a dense spread of receptors for a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which Fisher came to think of as part of our own endogenous love potion. In the right proportions, dopamine creates intense energy, exhilaration, focused attention, and motivation to win rewards. It is why, when you are newly in love, you can stay up all night, watch the sun rise, run a race, ski fast down a slope ordinarily too steep for your skill. Love makes you bold, makes you bright, makes you run real risks, which you sometimes survive, and sometimes you don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I first fell in love when I was only 12, with a teacher. His name was Mr. McArthur, and he wore open-toed sandals and sported a beard. I had never had a male teacher before, and I thought it terribly exotic. Mr. McArthur did things no other teacher dared to do. He explained to us the physics of farting. He demonstrated how to make an egg explode. He smoked cigarettes at recess, leaning languidly against the side of the school building, the ash growing longer and longer until he casually tapped it off with his finger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What unique constellation of needs led me to love a man who made an egg explode is interesting, perhaps, but not as interesting, for me, as my memory of love&rsquo;s sheer physical facts. I had never felt anything like it before. I could not get Mr. McArthur out of my mind. I was anxious; I gnawed at the lining of my cheek until I tasted the tang of blood. School became at once terrifying and exhilarating. Would I see him in the hallway? In the cafeteria? I hoped. But when my wishes were granted, and I got a glimpse of my man, it satisfied nothing; it only inflamed me all the more. Had he looked at me? Why had he not looked at me? When would I see him again? At home I looked him up in the phone book; I rang him, this in a time before caller ID. He answered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Pain in my heart, ripped down the middle. Hang up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Call back. &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; I never said a thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once I called him at night, late, and from the way he answered the phone it was clear, even to a prepubescent like me, that he was with a woman. His voice fuzzy, the tinkle of her laughter in the background. I didn&rsquo;t get out of bed for a whole day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound familiar? Maybe you were 30 when it happened to you, or 8 or 80 or 25. Maybe you lived in Kathmandu or Kentucky; age and geography are irrelevant. Donatella Marazziti is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pisa in Italy who has studied the biochemistry of lovesickness. Having been in love twice herself and felt its awful power, Marazziti became interested in exploring the similarities between love and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She and her colleagues measured serotonin levels in the blood of 24 subjects who had fallen in love within the past six months and obsessed about this love object for at least four hours every day. Serotonin is, perhaps, our star neurotransmitter, altered by our star psychiatric medications: Prozac and Zoloft and Paxil, among others. Researchers have long hypothesized that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have a serotonin &ldquo;imbalance.&rdquo; Drugs like Prozac seem to alleviate OCD by increasing the amount of this neurotransmitter available at the juncture between neurons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marazziti compared the lovers&rsquo; serotonin levels with those of a group of people suffering from OCD and another group who were free from both passion and mental illness. Levels of serotonin in both the obsessives&rsquo; blood and the lovers&rsquo; blood were 40 percent lower than those in her normal subjects. Translation: Love and obsessive-compulsive disorder could have a similar chemical profile. Translation: Love and mental illness may be difficult to tell apart. Translation: Don&rsquo;t be a fool. Stay away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course that&rsquo;s a mandate none of us can follow. We do fall in love, sometimes over and over again, subjecting ourselves, each time, to a very sick state of mind. There is hope, however, for those caught in the grip of runaway passion&mdash;Prozac. There&rsquo;s nothing like that bicolored bullet for damping down the sex drive and making you feel &ldquo;blah&rdquo; about the buffet. Helen Fisher believes that the ingestion of drugs like Prozac jeopardizes one&rsquo;s ability to fall in love&mdash;and stay in love. By dulling the keen edge of love and its associated libido, relationships go stale. Says Fisher, &ldquo;I know of one couple on the edge of divorce. The wife was on an antidepressant. Then she went off it, started having orgasms once more, felt the renewal of sexual attraction for her husband, and they&rsquo;re now in love all over again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Psychoanalysts have concocted countless theories about why we fall in love with whom we do. Freud would have said your choice is influenced by the unrequited wish to bed your mother, if you&rsquo;re a boy, or your father, if you&rsquo;re a girl. Jung believed that passion is driven by some kind of collective unconscious. Today psychiatrists such as Thomas Lewis from the University of California at San Francisco&rsquo;s School of Medicine hypothesize that romantic love is rooted in our earliest infantile experiences with intimacy, how we felt at the breast, our mother&rsquo;s face, these things of pure unconflicted comfort that get engraved in our brain and that we ceaselessly try to recapture as adults. According to this theory we love whom we love not so much because of the future we hope to build but because of the past we hope to reclaim. Love is reactive, not proactive, it arches us backward, which may be why a certain person just &ldquo;feels right.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;feels familiar.&rdquo; He or she is familiar. He or she has a certain look or smell or sound or touch that activates buried memories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first met my husband, I believed this psychological theory was more or less correct. My husband has red hair and a soft voice. A chemist, he is whimsical and odd. One day before we married he dunked a rose in liquid nitrogen so it froze, whereupon he flung it against the wall, spectacularly shattering it. That&rsquo;s when I fell in love with him. My father, too, has red hair, a soft voice, and many eccentricities. He was prone to bursting into song, prompted by something we never saw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it turns out my theories about why I came to love my husband may be just so much hogwash. Evolutionary psychology has said good riddance to Freud and the Oedipal complex and all that other transcendent stuff and hello to simple survival skills. It hypothesizes that we tend to see as attractive, and thereby choose as mates, people who look healthy. And health, say these evolutionary psychologists, is manifested in a woman with a 70 percent waist-to-hip ratio and men with rugged features that suggest a strong supply of testosterone in their blood. Waist-to-hip ratio is important for the successful birth of a baby, and studies have shown this precise ratio signifies higher fertility. As for the rugged look, well, a man with a good dose of testosterone probably also has a strong immune system and so is more likely to give his partner healthy children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps our choice of mates is a simple matter of following our noses. Claus Wedekind of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland did an interesting experiment with sweaty T-shirts. He asked 49 women to smell T-shirts previously worn by unidentified men with a variety of the genotypes that influence both body odor and immune systems. He then asked the women to rate which T-shirts smelled the best, which the worst. What Wedekind found was that women preferred the scent of a T-shirt worn by a man whose genotype was most different from hers, a genotype that, perhaps, is linked to an immune system that possesses something hers does not. In this way she increases the chance that her offspring will be robust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all seems too good to be true, that we are so hardwired and yet unconscious of the wiring. Because no one to my knowledge has ever said, &ldquo;I married him because of his B.O.&rdquo; No. We say, &ldquo;I married him (or her) because he&rsquo;s intelligent, she&rsquo;s beautiful, he&rsquo;s witty, she&rsquo;s compassionate.&rdquo; But we may just be as deluded about love as we are when we&rsquo;re&nbsp;<em>in</em>&nbsp;love. If it all comes down to a sniff test, then dogs definitely have the edge when it comes to choosing mates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t passionate love last? How is it possible to see a person as beautiful on Monday, and 364 days later, on another Monday, to see that beauty as bland? Surely the object of your affection could not have changed that much. She still has the same shaped eyes. Her voice has always had that husky sound, but now it grates on you&mdash;she sounds like she needs an antibiotic. Or maybe you&rsquo;re the one who needs an antibiotic, because the partner you once loved and cherished and saw as though saturated with starlight now feels more like a low-level infection, tiring you, sapping all your strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies around the world confirm that, indeed, passion usually ends. Its conclusion is as common as its initial flare. No wonder some cultures think selecting a lifelong mate based on something so fleeting is folly. Helen Fisher has suggested that relationships frequently break up after four years because that&rsquo;s about how long it takes to raise a child through infancy. Passion, that wild, prismatic insane feeling, turns out to be practical after all. We not only need to copulate; we also need enough passion to start breeding, and then feelings of attachment take over as the partners bond to raise a helpless human infant. Once a baby is no longer nursing, the child can be left with sister, aunts, friends. Each parent is now free to meet another mate and have more children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biologically speaking, the reasons romantic love fades may be found in the way our brains respond to the surge and pulse of dopamine that accompanies passion and makes us fly. Cocaine users describe the phenomenon of tolerance: The brain adapts to the excessive input of the drug. Perhaps the neurons become desensitized and need more and more to produce the high&mdash;to put out pixie dust, metaphorically speaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing that romance fizzles. Would we have railroads, bridges, planes, faxes, vaccines, and television if we were all always besotted? In place of the ever evolving technology that has marked human culture from its earliest tool use, we would have instead only bonbons, bouquets, and birth control. More seriously, if the chemically altered state induced by romantic love is akin to a mental illness or a drug-induced euphoria, exposing yourself for too long could result in psychological damage. A good sex life can be as strong as Gorilla Glue, but who wants that stuff on your skin?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once upon a time, in India, a boy and a girl fell in love without their parents&rsquo; permission. They were from different castes, their relationship radical and unsanctioned. Picture it: the sparkling sari, the boy in white linen, the clandestine meetings on tiled terraces with a fat, white moon floating overhead. Who could deny these lovers their pleasure, or condemn the force of their attraction?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their parents could. In one recent incident a boy and girl from different castes were hanged at the hands of their parents as hundreds of villagers watched. A couple who eloped were stripped and beaten. Yet another couple committed suicide after their parents forbade them to marry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anthropologists used to think that romance was a Western construct, a bourgeois by-product of the Middle Ages. Romance was for the sophisticated, took place in caf&eacute;s, with coffees and Cabernets, or on silk sheets, or in rooms with a flickering fire. It was assumed that non-Westerners, with their broad familial and social obligations, were spread too thin for particular passions. How could a collectivist culture celebrate or in any way sanction the obsession with one individual that defines new love? Could a lice-ridden peasant really feel passion?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Easily, as it turns out. Scientists now believe that romance is panhuman, embedded in our brains since Pleistocene times. In a study of 166 cultures, anthropologists William Jankowiak and Edward Fischer observed evidence of passionate love in 147 of them. In another study men and women from Europe, Japan, and the Philippines were asked to fill out a survey to measure their experiences of passionate love. All three groups professed feeling passion with the same searing intensity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But though romantic love may be universal, its cultural expression is not. To the Fulbe tribe of northern Cameroon, poise matters more than passion. Men who spend too much time with their wives are taunted, and those who are weak-kneed are thought to have fallen under a dangerous spell. Love may be inevitable, but for the Fulbe its manifestations are shameful, equated with sickness and social impairment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In India romantic love has traditionally been seen as dangerous, a threat to a well-crafted caste system in which marriages are arranged as a means of preserving lineage and bloodlines. Thus the gruesome tales, the warnings embedded in fables about what happens when one&rsquo;s wayward impulses take over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today love marriages appear to be on the rise in India, often in defiance of parents&rsquo; wishes. The triumph of romantic love is celebrated in Bollywood films. Yet most Indians still believe arranged marriages are more likely to succeed than love marriages. In one survey of Indian college students, 76 percent said they&rsquo;d marry someone with all the right qualities even if they weren&rsquo;t in love with the person (compared with only 14 percent of Americans). Marriage is considered too important a step to leave to chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renu Dinakaran is a striking 45-year-old woman who lives in Bangalore, India. When I meet her, she is dressed in Western-style clothes &mdash;black leggings and a T-shirt. Renu lives in a well-appointed apartment in this thronging city, where cows sleep on the highways as tiny cars whiz around them, plumes of black smoke rising from their sooty pipes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renu was born into a traditional Indian family where an arranged marriage was expected. She was not an arranged kind of person, though, emerging from her earliest days as a fierce tennis player, too sweaty for saris, and smarter than many of the men around her. Nevertheless at the age of 17 she was married off to a first cousin, a man she barely knew, a man she wanted to learn to love, but couldn&rsquo;t. Renu considers many arranged marriages to be acts of &ldquo;state-sanctioned rape.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renu hoped to fall in love with her husband, but the more years that passed, the less love she felt, until, at the end, she was shrunken, bitter, hiding behind the curtains of her in-laws&rsquo; bungalow, looking with longing at the couple on the balcony across from theirs. &ldquo;It was so obvious to me that couple had married for love, and I envied them. I really did. It hurt me so much to see how they stood together, how they went shopping for bread and eggs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exhausted from being forced into confinement, from being swaddled in saris that made it difficult to move, from resisting the pressure to eat off her husband&rsquo;s plate, Renu did what traditional Indian culture forbids one to do. She left. By this time she had had two children. She took them with her. In her mind was an old movie she&rsquo;d seen on TV, a movie so strange and enticing to her, so utterly confounding and comforting at the same time, that she couldn&rsquo;t get it out of her head. It was 1986. The movie was&nbsp;<em>Love Story</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Before I saw movies like&nbsp;<em>Love Story</em>, I didn&rsquo;t realize the power that love can have,&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renu was lucky in the end. In Mumbai she met a man named Anil, and it was then, for the first time, that she felt passion. &ldquo;When I first met Anil, it was like nothing I&rsquo;d ever experienced. He was the first man I ever had an orgasm with. I was high, just high, all the time. And I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t last, couldn&rsquo;t last, and so that infused it with a sweet sense of longing, almost as though we were watching the end approach while we were also discovering each other.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Renu speaks of the end, she does not, to be sure, mean the end of her relationship with Anil; she means the end of a certain stage. The two are still happily married, companionable, loving if not &ldquo;in love,&rdquo; with a playful black dachshund they bought together. Their relationship, once so full of fire, now seems to simmer along at an even temperature, enough to keep them well fed and warm. They are grateful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Would I want all that passion back?&rdquo; Renu asks. &ldquo;Sometimes, yes. But to tell you the truth, it was exhausting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a physiological point of view, this couple has moved from the dopamine-drenched state of romantic love to the relative quiet of an oxytocin-induced attachment. Oxytocin is a hormone that promotes a feeling of connection, bonding. It is released when we hug our long-term spouses, or our children. It is released when a mother nurses her infant. Prairie voles, animals with high levels of oxytocin, mate for life. When scientists block oxytocin receptors in these rodents, the animals don&rsquo;t form monogamous bonds and tend to roam. Some researchers speculate that autism, a disorder marked by a profound inability to forge and maintain social connections, is linked to an oxytocin deficiency. Scientists have been experimenting by treating autistic people with oxytocin, which in some cases has helped alleviate their symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In long-term relationships that work&mdash;like Renu and Anil&rsquo;s&mdash;oxytocin is believed to be abundant in both partners. In long-term relationships that never get off the ground, like Renu and her first husband&rsquo;s, or that crumble once the high is gone, chances are the couple has not found a way to stimulate or sustain oxytocin production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;But there are things you can do to help it along,&rdquo; says Helen Fisher. &ldquo;Massage. Make love. These things trigger oxytocin and thus make you feel much closer to your partner.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I suppose that&rsquo;s good advice, but it&rsquo;s based on the assumption that you still want to have sex with that boring windbag of a husband. Should you fake-it-till-you-make-it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Fisher. &ldquo;Assuming a fairly healthy relationship, if you have enough orgasms with your partner, you may become attached to him or her. You will stimulate oxytocin.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may be true. But it sounds unpleasant. It&rsquo;s exactly what your mother always said about vegetables: &ldquo;Keep eating your peas. They are an acquired taste. Eventually, you will come to like them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I have never been a peas person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s 90 degrees on the day my husband and I depart, from Boston for New York City, to attend a kissing school. With two kids, two cats, two dogs, a lopsided house, and a questionable school system, we may know how to kiss, but in the rough and tumble of our harried lives we have indeed forgotten how to kiss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sky is paved with clouds, the air as sticky as jam in our hands and on our necks. The Kissing School, run by Cherie Byrd, a therapist from Seattle, is being held on the 12th floor of a run-down building in Manhattan. Inside, the room is whitewashed; a tiled table holds bottles of banana and apricot nectar, a pot of green tea, breath mints, and Chapstick. The other Kissing School students&mdash;sometimes they come from as far away as Vietnam and Nigeria&mdash;are sprawled happily on the bare floor, pillows and blankets beneath them. The class will be seven hours long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Byrd starts us off with foot rubs. &ldquo;In order to be a good kisser,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;you need to learn how to do the foreplay before the kissing.&rdquo; Foreplay involves rubbing my husband&rsquo;s smelly feet, but that is not as bad as when he has to rub mine. Right before we left the house, I accidentally stepped on a diaper the dog had gotten into, and although I washed, I now wonder how well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Inhale,&rdquo; Byrd says, and shows us how to draw in air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Exhale,&rdquo; she says, and then she jabs my husband in the back. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t focus on the toes so much,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Move on to the calf.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Byrd tells us other things about the art of kissing. She describes the movement of energy through various chakras, the manifestation of emotion in the lips; she describes the importance of embracing all your senses, how to make eye contact as a prelude, how to whisper just the right way. Many hours go by. My cell phone rings. It&rsquo;s our babysitter. Our one-year-old has a high fever. We must cut the long lesson short. We rush out. Later on, at home, I tell my friends what we learned at Kissing School: We don&rsquo;t have time to kiss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A perfectly typical marriage. Love in the Western world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily I&rsquo;ve learned of other options for restarting love. Arthur Aron, a psychologist at Stony Brook University in New York, conducted an experiment that illuminates some of the mechanisms by which people become and stay attracted. He recruited a group of men and women and put opposite sex pairs in rooms together, instructing each pair to perform a series of tasks, which included telling each other personal details about themselves. He then asked each couple to stare into each other&rsquo;s eyes for two minutes. After this encounter, Aron found most of the couples, previously strangers to each other, reported feelings of attraction. In fact, one couple went on to marry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fisher says this exercise works wonders for some couples. Aron and Fisher also suggest doing novel things together, because novelty triggers dopamine in the brain, which can stimulate feelings of attraction. In other words, if your heart flutters in his presence, you might decide it&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;re anxious but because you love him. Carrying this a step further, Aron and others have found that even if you just jog in place and then meet someone, you&rsquo;re more likely to think they&rsquo;re attractive. So first dates that involve a nerve-racking activity, like riding a roller coaster, are more likely to lead to second and third dates. That&rsquo;s a strategy worthy of posting on Match.com. Play some squash. And in times of stress&mdash;natural disasters, blackouts, predators on the prowl&mdash;lock up tight and hold your partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Somerville, Massachusetts, where I live with my husband, our predators are primarily mosquitoes. That needn&rsquo;t stop us from trying to enter the windows of each other&rsquo;s soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I propose this to Benjamin, he raises an eyebrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just go out for Cambodian food?&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s not how the experiment happened.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a scientist, my husband is always up for an experiment. But our lives are so busy that, in order to do this, we have to make a plan. We will meet next Wednesday at lunchtime and try the experiment in our car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Tuesday night before our rendezvous, I have to make an unplanned trip to New York. My husband is more than happy to forget our date. I, however, am not. That night, from my hotel room, I call him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We can do it on the phone,&rdquo; I say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What am I supposed to stare into?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;The keypad?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a picture of me hanging in the hall. Look at that for two minutes. I&rsquo;ll look at a picture I have of you in my wallet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Be a sport,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe not. Two minutes seems like a long time to stare at someone&rsquo;s picture with a receiver pressed to your ear. My husband sneezes, and I try to imagine his picture sneezing right along with him, and this makes me laugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another 15 seconds pass, slowly, each second stretched to its limit so I can almost hear time, feel time, its taffy-like texture, the pop it makes when it&rsquo;s done. Pop pop pop. I stare and stare at my husband&rsquo;s picture. It doesn&rsquo;t produce any sense of startling intimacy, and I feel defeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, I keep on. I can hear him breathing on the other end. The photograph before me was taken a year or so ago, cut to fit my wallet, his strawberry blond hair pulled back in a ponytail. I have never really studied it before. And I realize that in this picture my husband is not looking straight back at me, but his pale blue eyes are cast sideways, off to the left, looking at something I can&rsquo;t see. I touch his eyes. I peer close, and then still closer, at his averted face. Is there something sad in his expression, something sad in the way he gazes off?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I look toward the side of the photo, to find what it is he&rsquo;s looking at, and then I see it: a tiny turtle coming toward him. Now I remember how he caught it after the camera snapped, how he held it gently in his hands, showed it to our kids, stroked its shell, his forefinger moving over the scaly dome, how he held the animal out toward me, a love offering.

And when we do fall, why do our faculties of reason--and decency and self-respect and even right and wrong--sometimes not come along? For that matter, why would anyone reciprocate the love of a partner who has come so romantically unhinged?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thought of a loved one can turn our wits upside down, ratchet up our heart rate, impel us to slay dragons and write corny songs. We may become morose, obsessive, even violent. Lovesickness has been blamed on the moon, on the devil, but whatever is behind it, it doesn&#39;t look like the behavior of a rational animal trying to survive and reproduce. But might there be a method to this amorous madness?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the decades that the concept of human nature was taboo in academia, many scholars claimed that romantic love was a recent social construction. It was an invention of the Hallmark-card poets or Hollywood scriptwriters or, in one theory, medieval troubadours extolling the adulterous love of a knight for a lady.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For anyone who has been under love&#39;s spell, these theories seem preposterous, and so they are. Nothing so primal could have been created out of thin air as a mere custom or product. To the contrary, romantic love is a human universal. In 1896 a Kwakiutl Indian in southern Alaska wrote the lament &quot;Fire runs through my body--the pain of loving you,&quot; which could be the title of a bad power ballad today. Similar outpourings of passion can be found all over the world from those with broken hearts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Romantic infatuation is different from both raw lust and the enduring commitment that keeps lovers together long after their besottedness has faded. We all know the symptoms: idealized thoughts of the loved one; swings of mood from ecstasy to despair, insomnia and anorexia; and the intense need for signs of reciprocation. Even the brain chemistry is different: lust is fueled (in both sexes) by testosterone, and companionate love by vasopressin and oxytocin. Romantic passion taps the same dopamine system that is engaged by other obsessive drives like drug addiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all this, there may be a paradoxical logic to romantic love. Imagine a world without it, a world of rational shoppers looking for the best available mate. Unsentimental social scientists and veterans of the singles scene know that this world is not entirely unlike our own. People shop for the most desirable person who will accept them, and that is why most marriages pair a bride and a groom of roughly equal desirability. The 10s marry the 10s, the 9s marry the 9s and so on. That is exactly what should happen in a marketplace where you want the best price you can get (the other person) for the goods you&#39;re offering (you).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we also know this isn&#39;t the whole picture. Most daters find themselves at some point with a match who ought to be perfect but with whom for some reason the chemistry isn&#39;t there. Why do the principles of smart shopping give us only the rough statistics of mate choice, not the final pick?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason is that smart shopping isn&#39;t enough; both parties have to close the deal. Somewhere in this world lives the best-looking, richest, smartest person who would settle for you. But this ideal match is hard to find, and you may die single if you insist on waiting for such a mate to show up. So you choose to set up house with the best person you have found so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your mate has gone through the same reasoning, which leaves you both vulnerable. The law of averages says that someday one of you will meet an even more desirable person; maybe a newly single Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie will move in next door. If you are always going for the best you can get, at that point you will dump your partner pronto. But your partner would have invested time, child rearing and forgone opportunities in the relationship by that point. Anticipating this, your mate would have been foolish to enter the relationship in the first place, and the same is true for you. In this world of rational actors, neither of you could thus take the chance on the other. What could make you trust the other person enough to make that leap?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One answer is, Don&#39;t accept a partner who wanted you for rational reasons to begin with. Look for someone who is emotionally committed to you because you are you. If the emotion moving that person is not triggered by your objective mate value, that emotion will not be alienated by someone who comes along with greater mate value than yours. And there should be signals that the emotion is not faked, showing that the person&#39;s behavior is under the control of the involuntary parts of the brain--the ones in charge of heart rate, breathing, skin flushing and so on. Does this emotion sound familiar?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This explanation of infatuation was devised by the economist Robert Frank on the basis of the work of Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling. Social life is a series of promises, threats and bargains; in those games it sometimes pays to sacrifice your self-interest and control. An eco-protester who handcuffs himself to a tree guarantees that his threat to impede the logger is credible. The prospective home buyer who makes an unrecoverable deposit guarantees that her promise to buy the house is credible. And suitors who are uncontrollably smitten are in effect guaranteeing that their pledge of love is credible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this gets us to the dark side of romance. Threats, no less than promises, must be backed up by signs of commitment. A desperate lover in danger of being abandoned may resort to threatening his wife or girlfriend (yes, his; it&#39;s usually a man). The best way to prevent her from calling his bluff is in fact not to bluff--to be the kind of hothead who is crazy enough to do it. Of course, if he does make good on the threat, everyone loses (which is why the judicial system must make good on its threat to punish violent thugs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This perverse logic of promises and threats lies behind the observation on romance offered by George Bernard Shaw: &quot;When we want to read of the deeds that are done for love, whither do we turn? To the murder column.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinker is the Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and the author, most recently, of The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature</p>\r\n', 'Crazy Love', 1, 1, '0'),

Almost immediately, he was surprised by the difficulty he had meeting women. Having lived in New York and the Boston area, he was accustomed to ready-made social scenes. In Portland, by contrast, most of his friends were in long-term relationships with people they&rsquo;d met in college, and were contemplating marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacob was single for two years and then, at 26, began dating a slightly older woman who soon moved in with him. She seemed independent and low-maintenance, important traits for Jacob. Past girlfriends had complained about his lifestyle, which emphasized watching sports and going to concerts and bars. He&rsquo;d been called lazy, aimless, and irresponsible with money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before long, his new relationship fell into that familiar pattern. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been able to make a girl feel like she was the most important thing in my life,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always &lsquo;I wish I was as important as the basketball game or the concert.&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo; An only child, Jacob tended to make plans by negotiation: if his girlfriend would watch the game with him, he&rsquo;d go hiking with her. He was passive in their arguments, hoping to avoid confrontation. Whatever the flaws in their relationship, he told himself, being with her was better than being single in Portland again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After five years, she left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now in his early 30s, Jacob felt he had no idea how to make a relationship work. Was compatibility something that could be learned? Would permanence simply happen, or would he have to choose it? Around this time, he signed up for two online dating sites: Match.com, a paid site, because he&rsquo;d seen the TV ads; and Plenty of Fish, a free site he&rsquo;d heard about around town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was fairly incredible,&rdquo; Jacob remembers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an average-looking guy. All of a sudden I was going out with one or two very pretty, ambitious women a week. At first I just thought it was some kind of weird lucky streak.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After six weeks, Jacob met a 22-year-old named Rachel, whose youth and good looks he says reinvigorated him. His friends were jealous. Was this The One? They dated for a few months, and then she moved in. (Both names have been changed for anonymity.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rachel didn&rsquo;t mind Jacob&rsquo;s sports addiction, and enjoyed going to concerts with him. But there were other issues. She was from a blue-collar military background; he came from doctors. She placed a high value on things he didn&rsquo;t think much about: a solid credit score, a 40-hour workweek. Jacob also felt pressure from his parents, who were getting anxious to see him paired off for good. Although a younger girlfriend bought him some time, biologically speaking, it also alienated him from his friends, who could understand the physical attraction but couldn&rsquo;t really relate to Rachel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, Jacob had always been the kind of guy who didn&rsquo;t break up well. His relationships tended to drag on. His desire to be with someone, to not have to go looking again, had always trumped whatever doubts he&rsquo;d had about the person he was with. But something was different this time. &ldquo;I feel like I underwent a fairly radical change thanks to online dating,&rdquo; Jacob says. &ldquo;I went from being someone who thought of finding someone as this monumental challenge, to being much more relaxed and confident about it. Rachel was young and beautiful, and I&rsquo;d found her after signing up on a couple dating sites and dating just a few people.&rdquo; Having met Rachel so easily online, he felt confident that, if he became single again, he could always meet someone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After two years, when Rachel informed Jacob that she was moving out, he logged on to Match.com the same day. His old profile was still up. Messages had even come in from people who couldn&rsquo;t tell he was no longer active. The site had improved in the two years he&rsquo;d been away. It was sleeker, faster, more efficient. And the population of online daters in Portland seemed to have tripled. He&rsquo;d never imagined that so many single people were out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about 95&nbsp;percent certain,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that if I&rsquo;d met Rachel offline, and if I&rsquo;d never done online dating, I would&rsquo;ve married her. At that point in my life, I would&rsquo;ve overlooked everything else and done whatever it took to make things work. Did online dating change my perception of permanence? No doubt. When I sensed the breakup coming, I was okay with it. It didn&rsquo;t seem like there was going to be much of a mourning period, where you stare at your wall thinking you&rsquo;re destined to be alone and all that. I was eager to see what else was out there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The positive aspects&nbsp;of online dating are clear: the Internet makes it easier for single people to meet other single people with whom they might be compatible, raising the bar for what they consider a good relationship. But what if online dating makes it&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;easy to meet someone new? What if it raises the bar for a good relationship&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;high? What if the prospect of finding an ever-more-compatible mate with the click of a mouse means a future of relationship instability, in which we keep chasing the elusive rabbit around the dating track?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, no one knows exactly how many partnerships are undermined by the allure of the Internet dating pool. But most of the online-dating-company executives I interviewed while writing my new book,&nbsp;<em>Love in the Time of Algorithms</em>, agreed with what research appears to suggest: the rise of online dating will mean an overall decrease in commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The future will see better relationships but more divorce,&rdquo; predicts Dan Winchester, the founder of a free dating site based in the U.K. &ldquo;The older you get as a man, the more experienced you get. You know what to do with women, how to treat them and talk to them. Add to that the effect of online dating.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;I often wonder whether matching you up with great people is getting so efficient, and the process so enjoyable, that marriage will become obsolete.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Historically,&rdquo; says Greg Blatt, the CEO of Match.com&rsquo;s parent company, &ldquo;relationships have been billed as &lsquo;hard&rsquo; because, historically, commitment has been the goal. You could say online dating is simply changing people&rsquo;s ideas about whether commitment itself is a life value.&rdquo; Mate scarcity also plays an important role in people&rsquo;s relationship decisions. &ldquo;Look, if I lived in Iowa, I&rsquo;d be married with four children by now,&rdquo; says Blatt, a 40&#8209;something bachelor in Manhattan. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how it is.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another online-dating exec hypothesized an inverse correlation between commitment and the efficiency of technology. &ldquo;I think divorce rates will increase as life in general becomes more real-time,&rdquo; says Niccol&ograve; Formai, the head of social-media marketing at Badoo, a meeting-and-dating app with about 25&nbsp;million active users worldwide. &ldquo;Think about the evolution of other kinds of content on the Web&mdash;stock quotes, news. The goal has always been to make it faster. The same thing will happen with meeting. It&rsquo;s exhilarating to connect with new people, not to mention beneficial for reasons having nothing to do with romance. You network for a job. You find a flatmate. Over time you&rsquo;ll expect that constant flow. People always said that the need for stability would keep commitment alive. But that thinking was based on a world in which you didn&rsquo;t meet that many people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Societal values always lose out,&rdquo; says Noel Biderman, the founder of Ashley Madison, which calls itself &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s leading married dating service for discreet encounters&rdquo;&mdash;that is, cheating. &ldquo;Premarital sex used to be taboo,&rdquo; explains Biderman. &ldquo;So women would become miserable in marriages, because they wouldn&rsquo;t know any better. But today, more people have had failed relationships, recovered, moved on, and found happiness. They realize that that happiness, in many ways, depends on having had the failures. As we become more secure and confident in our ability to find someone else, usually someone better, monogamy and the old thinking about commitment will be challenged very harshly.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even at eHarmony&mdash;one of the most conservative sites, where marriage and commitment seem to be the only acceptable goals of dating&mdash;Gian Gonzaga, the site&rsquo;s relationship psychologist, acknowledges that commitment is at odds with technology. &ldquo;You could say online dating allows people to get into relationships, learn things, and ultimately make a better selection,&rdquo; says Gonzaga. &ldquo;But you could also easily see a world in which online dating leads to people leaving relationships the moment they&rsquo;re not working&mdash;an overall weakening of commitment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, the profit models of many online-dating sites are at cross-purposes with clients who are trying to develop long-term commitments. A permanently paired-off dater, after all, means a lost revenue stream. Explaining the mentality of a typical dating-site executive, Justin Parfitt, a dating entrepreneur based in San Francisco, puts the matter bluntly: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re thinking,&nbsp;<em>Let&rsquo;s keep this fucker coming back to the site as often as we can</em>.&rdquo; For instance, long after their accounts become inactive on Match.com and some other sites, lapsed users receive notifications informing them that wonderful people are browsing their profiles and are eager to chat. &ldquo;Most of our users are return customers,&rdquo; says Match.com&rsquo;s Blatt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, Mark Brooks, a consultant to online-dating companies, published the results of an industry survey titled &ldquo;How Has Internet Dating Changed Society?&rdquo; The survey responses, from 39 executives, produced the following conclusions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Internet dating has made people more disposable.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Internet dating may be partly responsible for a rise in the divorce rates.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Low quality, unhappy and unsatisfying marriages are being destroyed as people drift to Internet dating sites.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The market is hugely more efficient&nbsp;&hellip; People expect to&mdash;and this will be increasingly the case over time&mdash;access people anywhere, anytime, based on complex search requests&nbsp;&hellip; Such a feeling of access affects our pursuit of love&nbsp;&hellip; the whole world (versus, say, the city we live in) will, increasingly, feel like the market for our partner(s). Our pickiness will probably increase.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Above all, Internet dating has helped people of all ages realize that there&rsquo;s no need to settle for a mediocre relationship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alex Mehr, a co-founder of the dating site Zoosk, is the only executive I interviewed who disagrees with the prevailing view. &ldquo;Online dating does nothing more than remove a barrier to meeting,&rdquo; says Mehr. &ldquo;Online dating doesn&rsquo;t change my taste, or how I behave on a first date, or whether I&rsquo;m going to be a good partner. It only changes the process of discovery. As for whether you&rsquo;re the type of person who wants to commit to a long-term monogamous relationship or the type of person who wants to play the field, online dating has nothing to do with that. That&rsquo;s a personality thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surely personality will&nbsp;play a role in the way anyone behaves in the realm of online dating, particularly when it comes to commitment and promiscuity. (Gender, too, may play a role. Researchers are divided on the question of whether men pursue more &ldquo;short-term mates&rdquo; than women do.) At the same time, however, the reality that having too many options makes us less content with whatever option we choose is a well-documented phenomenon. In his 2004 book,&nbsp;<em>The Paradox of Choice</em>, the psychologist Barry Schwartz indicts a society that &ldquo;sanctifies freedom of choice so profoundly that the benefits of infinite options seem self-evident.&rdquo; On the contrary, he argues, &ldquo;a large array of options may diminish the attractiveness of what people&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;choose, the reason being that thinking about the attractions of some of the unchosen options detracts from the pleasure derived from the chosen one.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Psychologists who study relationships say that three ingredients generally determine the strength of commitment: overall satisfaction with the relationship; the investment one has put into it (time and effort, shared experiences and emotions, etc.); and the quality of perceived alternatives. Two of the three&mdash;satisfaction and quality of alternatives&mdash;could be directly affected by the larger mating pool that the Internet offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the selection stage, researchers have seen that as the range of options grows larger, mate-seekers are liable to become &ldquo;cognitively overwhelmed,&rdquo; and deal with the overload by adopting lazy comparison strategies and examining fewer cues. As a result, they are more likely to make careless decisions than they would be if they had fewer options, and this potentially leads to less compatible matches. Moreover, the mere fact of having chosen someone from such a large set of options can lead to doubts about whether the choice was the &ldquo;right&rdquo; one. No studies in the romantic sphere have looked at precisely how the range of choices affects overall satisfaction. But research elsewhere has found that people are less satisfied when choosing from a larger group: in one study, for example, subjects who selected a chocolate from an array of six options believed it tasted better than those who selected the same chocolate from an array of 30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On that other determinant of commitment, the quality of perceived alternatives, the Internet&rsquo;s potential effect is clearer still. Online dating is, at its core, a litany of alternatives. And evidence shows that the perception that one has appealing alternatives to a current romantic partner is a strong predictor of low commitment to that partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You can say three things,&rdquo; says Eli Finkel, a professor of social psychology at Northwestern University who studies how online dating affects relationships. &ldquo;First, the best marriages are probably unaffected. Happy couples won&rsquo;t be hanging out on dating sites. Second, people who are in marriages that are either bad or average might be at increased risk of divorce, because of increased access to new partners. Third, it&rsquo;s unknown whether that&rsquo;s good or bad for society. On one hand, it&rsquo;s good if fewer people feel like they&rsquo;re stuck in relationships. On the other, evidence is pretty solid that having a stable romantic partner means all kinds of health and wellness benefits.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s even before one takes into account the ancillary effects of such a decrease in commitment&mdash;on children, for example, or even society more broadly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilbert Feibleman, a divorce attorney and member of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, argues that the phenomenon extends beyond dating sites to the Internet more generally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a dramatic increase in cases where something on the computer triggered the breakup,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;People are more likely to leave relationships, because they&rsquo;re emboldened by the knowledge that it&rsquo;s no longer as hard as it was to meet new people. But whether it&rsquo;s dating sites, social media, e&#8209;mail&mdash;it&rsquo;s all related to the fact that the Internet has made it possible for people to communicate and connect, anywhere in the world, in ways that have never before been seen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Rachel left him, Jacob has met lots of women online. Some like going to basketball games and concerts with him. Others enjoy barhopping. Jacob&rsquo;s favorite football team is the Green Bay Packers, and when I last spoke to him, he told me he&rsquo;d had success using Packers fandom as a search criterion on OkCupid, another (free) dating site he&rsquo;s been trying out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of Jacob&rsquo;s relationships become physical very early. At one point he&rsquo;s seeing a paralegal and a lawyer who work at the same law firm, a naturopath, a pharmacist, and a chef. He slept with three of them on the first or second date. His relationships with the other two are headed toward physical intimacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He likes the pharmacist most. She&rsquo;s a girlfriend prospect. The problem is that she wants to take things slow on the physical side. He worries that, with so many alternatives available, he won&rsquo;t be willing to wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One night the paralegal confides in him: her prior relationships haven&rsquo;t gone well, but Jacob gives her hope; all she needs in a relationship is honesty. And he thinks,&nbsp;<em>Oh my God</em>. He wants to be a nice guy, but he knows that sooner or later he&rsquo;s going to start coming across as a serious asshole. While out with one woman, he has to silence text messages coming in from others. He needs to start paring down the number of women he&rsquo;s seeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People seeking commitment&mdash;particularly women&mdash;have developed strategies to detect deception and guard against it. A woman might withhold sex so she can assess a man&rsquo;s intentions. Theoretically, her withholding sends a message:&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m not just going to sleep with any guy that comes along</em>. Theoretically, his willingness to wait sends a message back:&nbsp;<em>I&rsquo;m interested in more than sex</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the pace of technology is upending these rules and assumptions. Relationships that begin online, Jacob finds, move quickly. He chalks this up to a few things. First, familiarity is established during the messaging process, which also often involves a phone call. By the time two people meet face-to-face, they already have a level of intimacy. Second, if the woman is on a dating site, there&rsquo;s a good chance she&rsquo;s eager to connect. But for Jacob, the most crucial difference between online dating and meeting people in the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world is the sense of urgency. Occasionally, he has an acquaintance in common with a woman he meets online, but by and large she comes from a different social pool. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re just going to run into each other again,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So you can&rsquo;t afford to be too casual. It&rsquo;s either &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s explore this&rsquo; or &lsquo;See you later.&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social scientists say that all sexual strategies carry costs, whether risk to reputation (promiscuity) or foreclosed alternatives (commitment). As online dating becomes increasingly pervasive, the old costs of a short-term mating strategy will give way to new ones. Jacob, for instance, notices he&rsquo;s seeing his friends less often. Their wives get tired of befriending his latest girlfriend only to see her go when he moves on to someone else. Also, Jacob has noticed that, over time, he feels less excitement before each new date. &ldquo;Is that about getting older,&rdquo; he muses, &ldquo;or about dating online?&rdquo; How much of the enchantment associated with romantic love has to do with scarcity (<em>this person is exclusively for me</em>), and how will that enchantment hold up in a marketplace of abundance (<em>this person could be exclusively for me, but so could the other two people I&rsquo;m meeting this week</em>)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using OkCupid&rsquo;s Locals app, Jacob can now advertise his location and desired activity and meet women on the fly. Out alone for a beer one night, he responds to the broadcast of a woman who&rsquo;s at the bar across the street, looking for a karaoke partner. He joins her. They spend the evening together, and never speak again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Each relationship is its own little education,&rdquo; Jacob says. &ldquo;You learn more about what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, what you really need and what you can go without. That feels like a useful process. I&rsquo;m not jumping into something with the wrong person, or committing to something too early, as I&rsquo;ve done in the past.&rdquo; But he does wonder: When does it end? At what point does this learning curve become an excuse for not putting in the effort to make a relationship last? &ldquo;Maybe I have the confidence now to go after the person I really want,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m worried that I&rsquo;m making it so I can&rsquo;t fall in love.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', 'A Million First Dates', 1, 1, '0'),

If you never learn anything new, never push yourself to think a bit harder, or never do anything that tests your limits - you&#39;ll probably end up feeling that life lacks meaning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the flip side, if you&#39;re completely out of your depth with a particular area of studying or work, you&#39;re unlikely to be unhappy, stressed and anxious.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Spiritual needs</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen life is busy, it&#39;s hard to take time for things which feel unproductive - like attending a religious service, meditating, taking a long bath, or praying. You might feel guilty about &quot;sitting there doing nothing&quot; if you&#39;re engaged in one of these activities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut it&#39;s crucially important for us to find space and distance from day-to-day life, in order to take a fresh look at things. Some great thinkers have flashes of inspiration in the bath (Archimedes&#39; Eureka moment comes to mind...). I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ve had your own experience that sometimes the solution to a tricky problem, or a new insight on life, comes when you&#39;re just relaxing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLetting yourself take the time you need, without feeling guilty, means that you&#39;ll be able to support your family and friends with your perspective on problems or situations that they might be in. You&#39;ll be in a better state to not only cope with, but excel in, your own life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo help others, you must help yourself first. If you try to help others initially, you will both remain unconscious and will not be able to guide them to the path. Sometimes what appears to the unskilled eye as a selfish gesture is really the most selfless gesture there is.</p>\r\n', 'Putting Yourself First!', 1, 1, '0'),

We all have problems, and the truth of the matter is that problems will never go away. They will just change form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne time you may be struggling with health, the next with money, and still the next with relationships. That is both the curse and blessing of life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, you don&#39;t have to suffer because everything isn&#39;t perfect in your life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Behind the Scenes of Problems</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nNothing becomes a problem until you label it so. You&#39;ve probably noticed that different people have different opinions of what problems are, and how much attention should be given to any one thing. This means that problems exist in our heads, and that we create them, define them, and fear them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Most Overlooked Secret</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe secret to dealing with life&#39;s problems is to realize that they are illusions of our imagination. Sure, they feel very real.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&#39;s say you&#39;re driving your car merrily down the highway, until someone cuts you off. You might fly off the handle, or you might not. It will depend on how you perceive the situation. It&#39;s an excellent example of how some people create something to complain about where others are completely fine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLife will always have &quot;problems&quot; and the way to deal with them is to let them be. You don&#39;t have to try to analyze, fantasize, or figure out your problems. Let them figure themselves out. The more you try, the more you fuel the problem, and the more miserable you become.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis doesn&#39;t mean you stop solving problems. It means you stop the compulsive worrying and fear-mongering inside your head.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>How to Stop the Compulsive Worrying</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can stop the madness by simply staying present, and letting whatever happens be. This can be extremely hard if you bump into a problem that is important to you, but it is through those big problems that the biggest changes occur.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Why is Life so Hard?</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLife can seem tough from time to time, but it is through those tough times that you grow as a human being. It&#39;s uncomfortable, but that&#39;s life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s a rollercoaster with both highs and lows, which we all have to live through, so you might as well learn how to deal with the lows. The more comfortable you become with life&#39;s problems, the more you&#39;ll enjoy life&#39;s gifts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLife is what it is, and most of life&#39;s problems are created by us. The problems are events in our life, no one is denying that, but the extrapolation that we do freaks us out, and then we wonder why we feel so bad.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s a life-long habit most of us have cultivated, which means we can change it.

However, accomplishment came to those who said, &quot;I can make it happen.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Italian sculptor Agostino d&#39;Antonio worked diligently on a large piece of marble. Unable to produce his desired masterpiece, he lamented, &quot;I can do nothing with it.&quot; Other sculptors also worked this difficult piece of marble, but to no avail. Michelangelo discovered the stone and visualized the possibilities in it. His &quot;I-can-make-it-happen&quot; attitude resulted in one of the world&#39;s masterpieces - David.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe experts of Spain concluded that Columbus&#39;s plans to discover a new and shorter route to the West Indies was virtually impossible. Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand ignored the report of the experts. &quot;I can make it happen,&quot; Columbus persisted. And he did. Everyone knew the world was flat, but not Columbus. The Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria, along with Columbus and his small band of followers, sailed to &quot;impossible&quot; new lands and thriving resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven the great Thomas Alva Edison discouraged his friend, Henry Ford, from pursuing his fledgling idea of a motorcar. Convinced of the worthlessness of the idea, Edison invited Ford to come and work for him. Ford remained committed and tirelessly pursued his dream. Although his first attempt resulted in a vehicle without reverse gear, Henry Ford knew he could make it happen. And, of course, he did.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Forget it,&quot; the experts advised Madame Curie. They agreed radium was a scientifically impossible idea. However, Marie Curie insisted, &quot;I can make it happen.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&#39;s not forget our friends Orville and Wilbur Wright. Journalists, friends, armed forces specialists, and even their father laughed at the idea of an airplane. &quot;What a silly and insane way to spend money. Leave flying to the birds,&quot; they jeered. &quot;Sorry,&quot; the Wright brothers responded. &quot;We have a dream, and we can make it happen.&quot; As a result, a place called Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, became the setting for the launching of their &quot;ridiculous&quot; idea.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, as you read these accounts under the magnificent lighting of your environment, consider the plight of Benjamin Franklin. He was admonished to stop the foolish experimenting with lighting. What an absurdity and waste of time! Why, nothing could outdo the fabulous oil lamp. Thank goodness Franklin knew he could make it happen. You too can make it happen!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>It Couldn&#39;t Be Done</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomebody said that it couldn&#39;t be done, But he with a chuckle replied That maybe it couldn&#39;t, but he would be one Who wouldn&#39;t say so &quot;till he tried.&quot; So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin On his face. If he worried, he hid it. He started to sing as he tackled the thing That couldn&#39;t be done, and he did it. Somebody scoffed: &quot;Oh, you&#39;ll never do that; At least no one ever has done it.&quot; But he took off his coat and took off his hat And the first thing he knew he&#39;d begun it. With the lift of his chin and a bit of a grin, Without any doubting or quiddit, He started to sing as he tackled the thing That couldn&#39;t be done, and he did it. There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done. There are thousands to prophesy failure. There are thousands to point out to you, one by one, the dangers that wait to assail you. But just buckle right in with a bit of a grin, then take off your coat and go to it; just start in to sing as you tackle the thing that cannot be done, and you&#39;ll do it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>From Candles to Soap</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1879, Procter and Gamble&#39;s best seller was candles. But the company was in trouble. Thomas Edison had invented the light bulb, and it looked as if candles would become obsolete. Their fears became reality when the market for candles plummeted since they were now sold only for special occasions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe outlook appeared to be bleak for Procter and Gamble. However, at this time, it seemed that destiny played a dramatic part in pulling the struggling company from the clutches of bankruptcy. A forgetful employee at a small factory in Cincinnati forgot to turn off his machine when he went to lunch. The result? A frothing mass of lather filled with air bubbles. He almost threw the stuff away but instead decided to make it into soap. The soap floated. Thus, Ivory soap was born and became the mainstay of the Procter and Gamble Company.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy was soap that floats such a hot item at that time? In Cincinnati, during that period, some people bathed in the Ohio River. Floating soap would never sink and consequently never got lost. So, Ivory soap became a best seller in Ohio and eventually across the country also.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike Procter and Gamble, never give up when things go wrong or when seemingly insinuations problems arise. Creativity put to work can change a problem and turn it into a gold mine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A Ten-Cent Idea</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen young F. W. Woolworth was a store clerk, he tried to convince his boss to have a ten-cent sale to reduce inventory. The boss agreed, and the idea was a resounding success. This inspired Woolworth to open his own store and price items at a nickel and a dime. He needed capital for such a venture, so he asked his boss to supply the capital for part interest in the store. His boss turned him down flat. &quot;The idea is too risky,&quot; he told Woolworth. &quot;There are not enough items to sell for five and ten cents.&quot; Woolworth went ahead without his boss&#39;s backing, and he not only was successful in his first store, but eventually he owned a chain of F. W. Woolworth stores across the nation. Later, his former boss was heard to remark, &quot;As far as I can figure out, every word I used to turn Woolworth down cost me about a million dollars.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Time To Think</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHenry Ford hired an efficiency expert to go through his plant. He said, &quot;Find the nonproductive people. Tell me who they are, and I will fire them!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe expert made the rounds with his clipboard in hand and finally returned to Henry Ford&#39;s office with his report. &quot;I&#39;ve found a problem with one of your administrators,&quot; he said. &quot;Every time I walked by, he was sitting with his feet propped up on the desk. The man never does a thing. I definitely think you should consider getting rid of him!&quot; When Henry Ford learned the name of the man the expert was referring to, Ford shook his head and said, &quot;I can&#39;t fire him. I pay that man to do nothing but think - and that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf an impulse comes to say some un-thoughtful word today that may drive a friend away, don&#39;t say it! If you&#39;ve heard a word of blame cast upon your neighbor&#39;s name. That may injure his fair fame, don&#39;t tell it! If malicious gossip&#39;s tongue some vile slander may have flung on the head of old or young, don&#39;t repeat it!

Of course, one needs to give due importance to work. But if any society works diligently in every other area but neglects the family, it would be the same as straightening deck chairs on the Titanic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe all seek happiness but what most of us discover is that happiness is a home-made product. If you have strong and effective relationship with family members - whether living together or apart - the resultant good vibes and mental solace tend to overflow into all other aspects of life. When your family is heading in the right direction, you are better able to perform and focus at work. On the other hand, if things aren&#39;t going well at home, it is difficult to be deeply happy anywhere else. Thus, it is supremely important that at home, with your family, you concentrate on creating a beautiful family culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarriage is more than a contractual relationship - it is a promise from each individual to stay true to their love and commitment. While I can&#39;t tell you how to choose the right mate, I can advise you to determine what your values and principles are - and who might be a complimentary companion. Write a personal mission statement, outlining what is important to you, how you envision marriage and what family means to you. When the time is right, share this with your companion and encourage him/her to do the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHappy marriages don&#39;t just happen - they are created with body, mind, heart and spirit. No one can afford to get lazy in their relationship with their spouse. It must be nurtured and tended to. And when it gets off the track, as all relationships tend to, from time to-time, we must correct our course and come back on track.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will find that going back to your own mission statement can act as the guiding force that brings you back - because you will live according to what matters most to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the best ways of keeping a marriage and family effective and healthy is by living the &quot;Seven Habits&quot;. These embody universal, timeless principles - they belong to you, to me and all the people in the world. They are not my creation. You already know these principles because you know them to be true and already exercise them to varying degrees. We have simply put a framework around principles and organized a systematic way of living them. Committing to these principles may help you strengthen your marriage and family ties. Here is a quick overview:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Be proactive</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe power to make a difference in your family lies within you. The place to begin is not with other family members, but with yourself. You have the freedom to choose your actions and you have four unique endowments to guide your responses to people, situations and your environment:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li>Self-awareness: Step outside of yourself and be aware of your motives, thoughts, feelings and you can decide what you need to change.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Imagination: You can envision what you can be and do.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Conscience: Listen to the inward voice that prompts you to do certain things. Develop it.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Independent will: You can choose what you desire to do, and you have the freedom and the power to do it. Begin with the end in mind.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDecide what you desire for yourself and the culture you would like to develop with your family. This vision is more powerful than any problems you may have in the past or present. Write down your vision in a mission statement and clarify your values, and principles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Put first things first</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrganize your priorities according to what matters most to you - in alignment with what you envisioned in Habit 2.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake certain your family has four basic systems in place:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li>Selecting goals and making family plans;</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Teaching and training at home;</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Communicating and solving problems together;</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Completing tasks and disciplining within the family</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Think win-win</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWin-win is mutual benefit. Win-lose is authoritarian - &quot;I&quot;, difficult decisions can be made but they are not implemented in a way that violates the larger context of thinking win-win. Thinking win-win is at the heart of an effective family culture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Understand, then be understood</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeek to understand what other family members feel or think - from their frame of reference - by listening with your ears, heart and mind. When you truly understand, then you can better explain your position or ideas. Listening and understanding is the catalyst that makes effectiveness possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Synergize</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nCooperate and seek third alternatives that neither single family member could come up with on their own. Through a willingness to communicate, to understand and think win-win, family members can solve most difficult problems or create opportunities that could not have been achieved individually.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Sharpen the saw</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRenew yourself and your family by taking care of your physical, mental, social and spiritual needs. Do not neglect these important human needs, or you will eventually pay the price. A beautiful family culture can deteriorate unless the batteries that give it its power are continually re-charged.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhichever part of the Globe you live, always remember it is a beautiful nation with rich histories, traditions and legacy. Your families are at the heart of your nation - do not neglect your most precious resource. We know with great surety that living principle-centered lives promises to strengthen us individually, in our marriage, in our families, in our communities and places of work. Stay true to your path and remember what matters most to you.</p>\r\n', 'Happiness Is Homemade', 0, 1, '0'),

You constantly have information streaming to you from people in the office, meetings, email, voice messages, texts. You&#39;re trying to keep on top of it all and it can sometimes feel practically impossible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what do you do? Begin by determining what&#39;s really important to get done. Separate what&#39;s important from what&#39;s just urgent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon&#39;t Get Caught in the &quot;Urgency Trap&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe problem with all the technological resources we have for communication is that they are making everything seem urgent. It can be very tempting to get caught up in it and spend most of your day responding to email instead of focusing on what&#39;s really important.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery activity has some degree of both importance and urgency. Generally items will fall into four categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li>Crisis: Important and Urgent</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Planning, Preparation and Prevention: Important but Not Urgent</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Trivial Work: Urgent but Not Important</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Time Wasters: Not Urgent and Not Important</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Plan to Prevent Crisis from Occurring</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s easy to believe everything is important. But, in reality, some things just are more important than others. If you tend to think everything is important, it will be very difficult to prioritize. If you find yourself living in the Crisis category most of the time, your productivity will weaken and you will quite simply just burn out. It&#39;s unsustainable. The only way out is to focus on what you can do to plan for, prepare and prevent the kinds of things that force you to operate in a crisis. When the crisis does occur, you&#39;ll be equipped to handle it and move on much more easily.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe next time you find yourself working late to meet a deadline, responding to an angry customer or co-worker, or rushing to solve a problem, really push yourself to come up with answers to some of these questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li>&quot;What could be done to prevent this from happening in the future?&quot;</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>&quot;What can I learn to make this easier next time?&quot;</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>&quot;Whose support or assistance needs to be involved?&quot;</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>&quot;What could occur in the future, and how can I anticipate it and plan to respond?&quot;</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Plan to Prevent Crisis from Occurring</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you answer those questions and take the necessary actions, you will be taking the actions that will help keep you out of the Crisis category for very long.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Focus on What&#39;s Important</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s important that you get in the habit of consistently identifying your most important activities and then implementing them as a priority. Other examples of things that are important but not Urgent include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li>Preparing for a meeting</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Planning a presentation</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Coaching and mentoring your staff</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Anticipating customer needs or requests</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Brainstorming ways to streamline internal processes</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Identifying your most important activities to accomplish each year, month</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Create a plan to identify your most important activities each week</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Discussing your team&#39;s most important priorities to focus on</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Prioritizing your daily to do list to focus on what&#39;s most important</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Enhancing your own professional development</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Become A Time Master</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLook for all the resources at your disposal that will help you develop the habits to consistently focus on your key priorities. Talk with your manager and team members to identify your top priorities and most important activities. Look for books, e-learning courses and live online time management training classes that can help you.

It&#39;s also important to develop entrepreneurial skills if you&#39;re in a job role where you&#39;re expected to develop a business, or &quot;take things forward&quot; more generally.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt&#39;s very easy to get lost trying to rate ourselves against our peers or even rate ourselves around society when it comes to success. Its actually depressing at times and inconclusive as you often get side tracked comparing apples to oranges. In our quest for success, we often look for some sort of ranking system to gauge how well we are doing and unfortunately decide to use others as the measure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is often an inaccurate scale as so many factors come into play, so many that it makes it unfair to compare yourself to others on any level. There are so many circumstances that dictate success it makes it impossible to find multiple people with identical circumstances to compare us to. Since we cannot compare ourselves to others, we must become our own competition and strive for perfection daily in order to move forward. We ultimately set the velocity at which we move. The results however are none that can be compared to others as every situation is as unique as the next.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe real point here is why do we worry about what others are doing if we ultimately shouldn&#39;t compare ourselves to them. The answer is jealousy and should end immediately. If you are someone that often finds yourself worrying about what others are doing, how they are doing it and where their wealth comes from, then start minding your own business and instead focus your energy on yourself and your work which is what will get you there, not finding out if your neighbor is in the Mafia or indeed a real estate guru. The best way to check if you are yourself is to ask yourself if you often form conclusions when faced with an individual who has attained a higher level of monetary success. Do you often find yourself guessing that perhaps this person was given wealth from past generations or that they are involved in negative activities that have led to financial success?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne should rather focus our energy and efforts on our own growth and not criticize others whose level of success is above ours. If you find yourself in such a negative position where a friend or relative seems to feel that way, then identify them as one whose lack of effort and lack of motivation is ultimately going to be the reason they fail, and separate yourself from that energy instantly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Defining Entrepreneurship</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome experts think of entrepreneurs as people who are willing to take risks that other people are not. Others define them as people who start and build successful businesses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThinking about the first of these definitions, entrepreneurship doesn&#39;t necessarily involve starting your own business. Many people who don&#39;t work for themselves are recognized as entrepreneurs within their organizations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegardless of how you define an &quot;entrepreneur,&quot; one thing is certain: becoming a successful entrepreneur isn&#39;t easy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, how does one person successfully take advantage of an opportunity, while another, equally knowledgeable person does not? Do entrepreneurs have a different genetic makeup? Or do they operate from a different vantage point, that somehow directs their decisions for them?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThough many researchers have studied the subject, there are no definitive answers. What we do know is that successful entrepreneurs seem to have certain traits in common.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCheck for yourself if you have these traits:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li>Interpersonal skills.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Critical and creative thinking skills.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Practical skills.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Optimism:</strong>&nbsp;Are you an optimistic thinker? Optimism is truly an asset, and it will help get you through the tough times that many entrepreneurs experience as they find a business model that works for them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Vision:</strong>&nbsp;Can you easily see where things can be improved? Can you quickly grasp the &quot;big picture,&quot; and explain this to others? And can you create a compelling vision of the future, and then inspire other people to engage with that vision?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Initiative:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have initiative, and instinctively start problem-solving or business improvement projects?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Desire for Control:</strong>&nbsp;Do you enjoy being in charge and making decisions? Are you motivated to lead others?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Drive and Persistence:</strong>&nbsp;Are you self-motivated and energetic? And are you prepared to work hard, for a very long time, to realize your goals?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Risk Tolerance:</strong>&nbsp;Are you able to take risks, and make decisions when facts are uncertain?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Resilience:</strong>&nbsp;Are you resilient, so that you can pick yourself up when things don&#39;t go as planned? And do you learn and grow from your mistakes and failures?&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Interpersonal Skills</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a successful entrepreneur, you&#39;ll have to work closely with people - this is where it is critical to be able to build great relationships with your team, customers, suppliers, shareholders, investors, and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome people are more gifted in this area than others, but, fortunately, you can learn and improve these skills. The types of interpersonal skills you&#39;ll need include:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Leadership and Motivation:</strong>&nbsp;Can you lead and motivate others to follow you and deliver your vision? And are you able to delegate work to others? As a successful entrepreneur, you&#39;ll have to depend on others to get beyond a very early stage in your business - there&#39;s just too much to do all on your own!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Communication Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Are you competent with all types of communication? You need to be able to communicate well to sell your vision of the future to investors, potential clients, team members, and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Listening:</strong>&nbsp;Do you hear what others are telling you? Your ability to listen can make or break you as an entrepreneur. Make sure that you&#39;re skilled at active listening and empathetic listening.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Personal Relations:</strong>&nbsp;Are you emotionally intelligent? The higher your EI, the easier it will be for you to work with others. The good news is that you can improve your emotional intelligence!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Negotiation:</strong>&nbsp;Are you a good negotiator? Not only do you need to negotiate keen prices, you also need to be able to resolve differences between people in a positive, mutually beneficial way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Ethics:</strong>&nbsp;Do you deal with people based on respect, integrity, fairness, and truthfulness? Can you lead ethically? You&#39;ll find it hard to build a happy, committed team if you deal with people - staff, customers or suppliers - in a shabby way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Critical and Creative Thinking Skills</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an entrepreneur, you also need to come up with fresh ideas, and make good decisions about opportunities and potential projects. Many people think that you&#39;re either born creative or you&#39;re not. However, creativity is a skill that you can develop if you invest the time and effort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Creative Thinking:</strong>&nbsp;Are you able to see situations from a variety of perspectives and come up with original ideas? (There are many creativity tools that will help you do this.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Problem Solving:</strong>&nbsp;How good are you at coming up with sound solutions to the problems you&#39;re facing? Tools such as Cause &amp; Effect Analysis, the 5 Whys Technique, and CATWOE are just some of the problem-solving tools that you&#39;ll need to be familiar with.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Recognizing Opportunities:</strong>&nbsp;Do you recognize opportunities when they present themselves? Can you spot a trend? And are you able to create a plan to take advantage of the opportunities you identify?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Practical Skills</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou also need the practical skills and knowledge needed to produce goods or services effectively, and run a company.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Goal Setting:</strong>&nbsp;Do you regularly set goals, create a plan to achieve them, and then carry out that plan?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Planning and Organizing:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have the talents, skills, and abilities necessary to achieve your goals? Can you coordinate people to achieve these efficiently and effectively. And do you know how to develop a coherent, well thought-through business plan, including developing and learning from appropriate financial forecasts?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Decision Making:</strong>&nbsp;How good are you at making decisions? Do you make them based on relevant information and by weighing the potential consequences? And are you confident in the decisions that you make? Core decision-making tools include Decision Tree Analysis, Grid Analysis, and Six Thinking Hats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou need knowledge in several areas when starting or running a business. For instance:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Business knowledge:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have a good general knowledge of the main functional areas of a business (sales, marketing, finance, and operations), and are you able to operate or manage others in these areas with a reasonable degree of competence?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Entrepreneurial knowledge:</strong>&nbsp;Do you understand how entrepreneurs raise capital? And do you understand the sheer amount of experimentation and hard work that may be needed to find a business model that works for you?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Opportunity-specific knowledge:</strong>&nbsp;Do you understand the market you&#39;re attempting to enter, and do you know what you need to do to bring your product or service to market?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Venture-specific knowledge:</strong>&nbsp;Do you know what you need to do to make this type of business successful? And do you understand the specifics of the business that you want to start?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a dreamer, you need to understand its significance and mind your own business. Never lose track of your vision for your life. Do not ever get so busy making a living that you forget to live your life.</p>\r\n', 'Mind Your Own Business', 0, 1, '0'),

It is a mental attitude that expects good and favorable results. A positive mind anticipates happiness, joy, health and a successful outcome of every situation and action. Whatever the mind expects, it finds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany have heard it said that another person cannot make you happy. The happiness will come from within you. Being confident is a choice and it will produce positive emotions. There has been much research done on being in a positive state. It will produce a sense of well-being and has even proven to have multiple health benefits. Successful living today being positive will change your life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe way that someone feels about themselves shows in the way they act. They always find funny things in everyday life that makes them and others happy. There is joy and cheerfulness that just rubs off on the people who are around them. The way they feel shows in their life because they are more relaxed and sleep better at night. They are not only physically assured but mentally as well. Most people have a spiritual connection that gives them the confident mindset in life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople who have a confident mindset take full advantage of their work force. They go in everyday with a smile on their face and the confidence that they have the ability to handle anything that comes their way. Their ability to take responsibility and not to blame others when something goes wrong shows that they have a handle on life. Negative emotions have no place with them on their way to success.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConfidence is so much better than looking back and thinking of what could have been. Confident people are ones that you want to be around because they make the most of the present and look forward to the future. They are in awe of the beauty of nature and good things around them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis behavior comes from choosing the atmosphere that one is around. It is best to surround yourself with assured people that are upbeat and thinking good thoughts. Try to avoid negative news and thinking on unpleasant things. This will be to your advantage in building the blocks in your life of thinking of good wholesome thoughts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Positive and negative thinking are both contagious.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of us affect, in one way or another, the people we meet. This happens instinctively and on a subconscious level, through thoughts and feelings transference, and through body language. People sense our aura and are affected by our thoughts, and vice versa. Is it any wonder that we want to be around positive people and avoid negative ones? People are more disposed to help us if we are positive, and they dislike and avoid anyone broadcasting negativity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNegative thoughts, words and attitude bring up negative and unhappy moods and actions. When the mind is negative, poisons are released into the blood, which cause more unhappiness and negativity. This is the way to failure, frustration and disappointment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Becoming a Positive Example to All</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeing positive, doing the right things and thinking the right things will produce the kind of behavior that is an example to all. It will be an encouragement to those around you and an example that they can follow. Watching your confident living will help those with negative tendencies to change the way they think. If it changes the course of their lives you have done a great thing. Being careful of the things we say also will manifest how we act. Our conversation should be complimentary and uplifting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeing tolerant of others is another advantage of being confident. We will not always be treated in the manner that is right. We are not responsible for the negative way that people treat us, but we are responsible for how we react to it. A positive person will realize that sometimes people are a product of their environment. Maybe they didn&#39;t have all of the advantages that you did. The right thing to do is to act in a positive way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is always positive to think of others.

The goal of reducing clutter is to eliminate the non-essentials and keep only what is needed. If you are cleaning out your closet, this means deciding which pile each thing belongs in. But when it comes to the contents of your mind, the choice is where you place your attention. What do you want to feed with your most precious resource - your attention? We must however be aware that the beginning of any change and any new direction starts within. More accurately it starts with a thought. No matter what that new journey will be, no matter how far it will take us, that first step will quietly, occur within the realms of our own mind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn uncluttered mind is still and pristine like a mountain lake on a windless day. Even if a ripple appears, the tranquility remains, undisturbed. Your actions are clean and efficient. In the spaciousness, you notice creative impulses, novel ideas, and boundless peace. You feel light, calm, and alive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Mental Noise</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo a great extend, much of this can be classified as mental noise. We are forced to deal with it, blocking it out when we can, doing our best to filter out small pieces that are actually useful to us. We as humans were simply not designed to deal with this much information all at once. This noise keeps us at a disadvantage. It prevents us from focusing on our goals, focusing on what truly matters. It keeps us disconnected from the big picture and from each other.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWithout the much needed mental clarity, no matter how many courses we may take, we are not prepared to recognize that which truly makes the difference in our lives, what brings us the lasting happiness that we seek.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Inquiry for Thoughts and Feelings</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAre you ready to de-clutter your mind? Experts suggest asking a series of questions to decide what to keep and what to let go of. Take each thought pattern, each emotion, and any internal experience that holds you back and pose these questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li>Do I need this? Is it essential or necessary?</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Does it serve me? Is it helpful or useful?</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Am I attached to it? Can I let it go?</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The Process of Letting Go</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet&#39;s be clear about what &quot;letting go&quot; means. It&#39;s not exactly like throwing away those clothes you haven&#39;t worn for five years - or is it?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLetting go might mean choosing to move your attention away from a non-essential thought or feeling every time it arises. Or, the process of asking these questions might automatically dispel a long-treasured, old, boring story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd sometimes the letting go is more of a process that happens over time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStart by asking yourself the three questions, and see what you discover. Maybe you will be ready to let go of a mindset that doesn&#39;t serve you. Or simply asking the questions may help the patterns loosen their grip.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDe-cluttering is not an order, or even a goal. With great wisdom and love, simply notice, inquire, receive, then watch what happens...effortlessly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Simple Breathing Meditation Technique</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is a step by step guide to a simple breathing meditation technique that can be helpful for de-cluttering your minds.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFind a quiet dark area where you will not be disturbed for a duration of your session. Assume a comfortable position sitting down, without leaning back.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li>With your eyes closed, take a couple of deep breaths to help you relax. Now, breath normally. Gently bring your attention to the air moving in and out of your nose. Feel the cool air entering your nostrils, rising up through the nose passages on inhale. Don&#39;t hold your breath. Feel the warmer air moving through and out of your nose at exhale. You can keep your eyes focused at the point between your eyebrows if you like.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Continue with your attention on the breath. Never force your breathing but allow it to naturally flow in and out of your nose. Thoughts will come up in your mind. One by one acknowledge them and gently return your mind to the breath. Watch your breath, never forcing it, simply observing. The thoughts will come and go, but the breath will continue, calmly and peacefully. It may be helpful to mentally repeat &quot;in&quot; while breathing in and &quot;out&quot; when breathing out.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>You may find that after a while, your breath will become shallower. This is normal and you should just go along with it. Don&#39;t force your breath. The key is simply to observe the air, become the air itself if you will. Let go of everything else, allow yourself to deeply merge with it. If your time is limited, you may want to set a gentle alarm in advance letting you know when the time is up. Slowly get out of the state of meditation but try to retain the calmness that you are experiencing. Bring this feeling of calmness with you when you&#39;re done.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThis simple practice will train your mind to focus on just one thing - in this case, your breathing. The effectiveness of this method comes from having a permanent point of attention. You may practice it as long as you&#39;d like. It is recommend to start for just 5 to 10 minutes per day and growing your practice from there. Eventually, this meditation practice may be performed sitting at your office during a break, on the bus, whenever you have some down time or need to focus yourself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe benefits of de-cluttering your mind are felt almost immediately. You will become more focused and prone to less distraction in general. All of your ideas will evolve more naturally. Your decisions will become more intuitive. Any task that you approach will be more manageable and easier to achieve. You will be ready to handle the new journeys or to improve your current ones. The answers will naturally come to you, just listen. This practice may also make you feel more peaceful and attuned to everything and everyone around you. You will realize that we all have the same desire for love, peace and appreciation that connects us all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo be in a position to create a brand new program we have to change the programming of the past. Clear the slate if you like. So let&#39;s get into how we can de-clutter our minds. It takes work, sacrifice and persistence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever this is the price you must pay to prepare the fertile garden in your mind. There is no such thing as something for nothing. The universe will only align with you when you are prepared to pay a price for what you will receive. I hope you can commit to the price being asked here. The rewards will far outweigh the asking price.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe process is working when you begin to feel a difference in your energy level.

It&#39;s all about how you think.&quot; - David Schirmer<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoney is energy and energy is always moving, always changing, moving in waves and cycles. Money will flow in and out of your life, like the ebb and flow of the ocean tides. At times you will find that money flows in easily, at other times, it flows out, and sometimes the tide of the flow of money will seem not to change at all, but you should know, that moment is called the turning of the tide, and the cycle will inevitably start over again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow you attract money is your responsibility; it is connected directly to your magnetic ability, that is to say, your energy vibration in relation to money. This varies from person to person and depends, to start with, on how much money you think you want or need to support you in the lifestyle of your choice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this article you will find out what may be stopping you from letting the abundance flow and how to be open to receiving increasingly larger amounts of money.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li><strong>Remain Conscious Of The Law Of Attraction</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>In simple words, if you focus on abundance, you get abundance, but if you focus on lack of money, you will create more of a lack of money. What you radiate and vibrate in your life with your thoughts, emotions, words and beliefs, you will attract to you. You start by asking with your desire, you receive, and then you allow &#39;it&#39; to come into your life.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Say &#39;Yes&#39; To Wealth</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>When you say &#39;yes&#39; to money, you include that in your vibration and you will attract money, and if you say &#39;no&#39; to money with your feelings, thoughts or emotions, you will also include that in your vibration. So, do not settle for what life throws your way, instead create your life just as you want it to be.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Think Positive Thoughts About Your Money</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Focus on what you have, versus what you do not have, and allow what you do not have only to serve as a light in helping you to see what you want to create. Think positively about the money that you have, visualize it growing, and flowing in and out of your bank account with ease. Feel good and get excited about creating money.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Create more money evidence in your environment</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Get rid of all the cheap things that you have and leave only good quality products. You should not go shopping often because you will end up buying many cheap things that emanate the energy of lack. Buy less often but more quality products that symbolize wealth.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Get into the vibration of abundance</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Raise your vibration so that you would become a vibrational match to the abundance. Focus only on positive things and symbols of abundance, speak positively and never get involved in the thoughts of hatred, envy or powerlessness, because such thoughts will materialize into negative manifestations.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Feel good about the subject of money</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>If someone brings up the subject of money, how does that make you feel? Do you feel interested to hear about it, eager for it, excited about it? Or do you feel fear, doubt, confusion and disempowerment? These are very different vibrations that tell what your financial point of attraction is.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Try to approach money from a respectable and positive attitude, and soon you will experience money flow into your life. If you feel that it is hard for you to express such attitude towards money, then it means you still hold some limiting beliefs about this subject.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Treat money with respect</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Pick up coins if you see them in the street, sort money neatly in your wallet, don&#39;t keep the money scattered in your bag or pocket. Have respect for money and money will flow to you.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Pay your bills on time. If you don&#39;t return money you owe, you will not get any money in return. If you hoard money, that&#39;s all the money you will have.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Donate money</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Give money away to charities, people that need help and for other good causes. Such money will be returned to you tenfold. This is a universal law.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Be grateful for the money and other good things you have in your life because the more grateful you are, the more things of the same nature will start flowing into your experience.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Be patient</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Enjoy the process of becoming abundant because then you will become wealthy sooner. However if you keep looking at the evidence that you still do not have money, be sure that the money will flow into your experience very slowly.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	You should have complete faith that the money will start flowing into your life, even if there is no evidence of it as yet. Try to ignore the absence of money and put all your energy into having faith that the money is coming - and it has to come.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep money in perspective in your life. It is simply a tool you can use to create the kind of lifestyle you desire. The hippie surfer is happy with minimum money inflow. His happiness does not depend on how much money he has. Don&#39;t make money the measure of your happiness either; life is far too grand for that. Open to the abundance vibration, expect money to flow in and out, to ebb and flow in a natural cycle in your life, and build your feelings of prosperity and happiness hand in hand but never from a place of need.</p>\r\n', 'Ways To Let The Money Flow Into Your Life', 0, 1, '0');

Stephen Covey, the leadership guru further adds that &quot;it&#39;s usually not the dramatic, the visible, the once-in-a-lifetime, up-by-the-bootstraps effort that brings enduring success. Empowerment comes from learning how to use this great endowment in the decisions we make every day.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe subordinate our dreams for our jobs, our bosses, our friends, our parents and a whole lot of other people and activities. We should instead place our hopes and dreams as the most important thing every day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The time management matrix</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost people spend their time doing things that are neither urgent nor important. One thing that immediately comes to mind is the person that spends every bit of his free time at the bar hanging out with the guys and just having a good time. I would not be very mistaken to say that such a person is not only drinking their income away, but also their dreams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTelevision is another not urgent and not important activity which, unfortunately, most of us spend a lot of our most productive time on. It is amazing how television sets in most homes are perpetually on and people are fixed on them like zombies, watching everything that is dished out to them! TVs have invaded our lives and crippled our dreams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Do the important things</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat we need to do is concentrate on the things that are most important. The hard part is that these are usually the things that are not urgent. Yet they are things that will make the biggest difference to our lives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy not turn off the television set tonight and read an inspiring book? Why not take a quiet moment to sit down and write down what you want to do with the rest of your life? Why not spend some time with your kids rather than with the guys at the bar?&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>It is not always fun</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you can see, the important things are usually not the most fun or exciting things to do always. However, they must be done. There is a price to be paid for attaining greatness and at times that means doing things we don&#39;t necessarily enjoy or want to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut you must do those things because you realize that your future depends on it. Think about this: if you only had to do the things that are fun and exciting at work would you get anything done? No. But you do it anyway, for the sake of that paycheck at the month-end. Why then, won&#39;t you do the things that matter most for your own life?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven are some quick tips that will help you to learn the art of Time Management better.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Schedule Your Day.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to learn how to improve your time management skills, then you need to have a concrete schedule for the day. Don&#39;t get out of bed thinking that you&#39;ll just wing it, because it often leads to a lot of time wastage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would be best to schedule and plan your tasks the night before, because your subconscious mind will help process their fulfillment while you&#39;re sleeping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Create A Check List.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have deadlines coming up, then you need to create a list arranged according to priority. This helps keep you on track and even encourages you to do more as fast as possible. There&#39;s nothing like a list to keep you motivated and pressured to do your job.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Stop Wasting Time.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nSpacing out for even just five minutes is a waste of time. Not taking a shortcut is also a waste of time. If you want to learn how to improve your time management skills, then you need to cut down on the activities that aren&#39;t related to work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChatting with your co-workers is fine; but perhaps you need to cut down on that too, especially if you have a deadline to meet.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Learn To Multi-task.</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMulti-tasking is not always advisable, especially if the tasks you&#39;re doing need your full concentration. In smaller tasks, however, I&#39;m sure you can do more than one thing at a time. Want some examples?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow about reading a book while waiting for the food you&#39;re cooking to boil? Perhaps one of the best multi-tasking activities you can do is listening to motivational CDs while on the go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have not done anything today to get you closer to your dreams you are not a dreamer, you are a wisher. Wake up and do something about it or watch the dreamers take hold of their dreams, one little step each day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the words of Jim Rohn, &quot;Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going,&quot; Develop the habit of putting first things first today. Work on your dreams each and every day. You are all you can be. Go on and be it!</p>\r\n', 'Time Management Skill', 1, 1, '0'),

It is natural process that involves a specific vibration of energy which you experience that will attract any heartfelt desire to you quickly and effortlessly! To start this process, you should think of something that you would like to have. Start from small things first because this will give you more faith as to that they will manifest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you manifest small things, you will be able to gradually progress to bigger and bigger ones. Some fail to manifest because they want to get large amounts of money, houses or cars with their first intention. But that does not work this way because you cannot possibly completely believe that such big things will manifest when you are just a beginner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>How to manifest your desires</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><br />\r\n	<li><strong>Slow Down, Relax and Fully Be Here Now.</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Being ever-present to this eternal moment is one of the most essential and basic key to manifesting. The mind will jump from past to the future and back again to the past, distracting you from the Infinite Source of power that is only here now. The entire Universe is happening only in this moment. If you are thinking about anything but this moment you are missing out on the Source that is connected to everyone and everything in it. The mind/ego is an extraordinary tool and is what we use to manifest our desires with. If the mind is free from the distracting thoughts about the past and future, then the amazing core of your magical manifesting power has room to come through! By slowing down you are able to shut off the mind chatter and tap directly into the infinite Source of manifesting power that is available ONLY in the Now. As you learn how to slow down your thoughts, your breathing and the movement of your body, eventually the mind comes to a halt and creates space of timelessness. Here we tap into the Infinite Source and you make contact with a super-natural power inside. When we live throughout our day at an enjoyable relaxed and peace filled pace, we can truly resource the intelligence and power in this eternal moment.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Remember, every idea begins with an intuitive hunch. We know we need certain things at certain times in our lives. There is an inner voice which tells us. We encounter omens or coincidences which point to it. Conversations trigger ideas through synchronicity. There are times when you know you want something.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Practice Stillness Everyday.</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>In order to stop the constant chattering of the mind, we need a conscious daily Meditation practice of training the mind. Manifesting happens instantly when you have made the mind to act according to your way. The longer you can maintain focus on your breath, the faster your goals will manifest for you. The actual time it takes to manifest is directly proportional to the number of minutes you can concentrate on what you want without distraction. Become the master of your thoughts, get to know this seat of consciousness inside.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Be clear on what it is you wish to create in your life. The more specific - the better. We teach making lists as a way to clarify what you want. The world is a reflection of our mind. We attract into our lives a reflection of the thoughts we project. If you really want anything, you can have it. Creating a crystal clear vision is an important step.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Make Conscious Contact With The Universe</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>The first step here is to acknowledge that there is a higher power inside you right now, and its very easily available to you. The next step is to be open to this extremely ever-present intelligent Source that is always happening everywhere you are. Believe and get to know your personal conscious connection with this sacred Omni-present Source of power. As you progress in your relationship with this very real divine intelligence, center your mind closer to your heart. You will come to know that God is closer to you than your heart, your mind or your next breath of air.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	By spending time getting clear on what you desire, you will recognize it when it turns up! That will provide you with certainty that you have found what you are looking for and give you the courage to complete the plan to manifestation.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Trust in Life&#39;s Magical Unfolding Process.</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>Be infinitely patient! Discover a deeper &quot;knowingness&quot; inside you that can help you let go of anxiety, disbelief and doubt. Decide and believe that your goal is on its way. The Universe is always supporting what you want and if you affirm what you want it will always help you to achieve it. The more you can surrender to this deeply wise and powerful feeling of trust and letting go, the more the Universe can help you. It&#39;s about getting in touch with that infinite patience that ignites and engages this manifesting process. The experience of Trust is really the greatest and deepest surrender to the Universe from the tiny ego trip we&#39;re on.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	Thus, be crystal clear on your outcome; daily visualize what you desire, but release the need to have it. When we project neediness, we block manifestation. When we don&#39;t care, miracles happen. Be confident. Release any negative thoughts. Affirm that what you desire is on the way with everyone you meet. Brush off any thoughts or comments that you can&#39;t achieve what you wish.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Focus on your Desired Outcome without Attachment to it.</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>When you allow your mind to ONLY have positive thoughts towards your desired outcome you are saying to the Universe that you are devoted to manifesting your dream. Being in a deep, positive, open connection with your desired outcome without being overly attached to it, is one of the greatest hidden keys to manifesting it. Positive thinking is a way of sending direct messages to the Universe saying what you want is important and sacred to you. Visualize, feel and imagine that your greatest dream is happening to you without clinging to it. Assume that your imagination is real! Honor and respect your goals in life as if they were given to you from the highest and most powerful being you can imagine.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	By now you need to put in place all that is necessary to make your dreams come true. Completely let go and it is a matter of time. We live in an infinite universe of absolute abundance. It is only our limiting beliefs which restrict our experience.</li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;\r\n	<li><strong>Love Yourself Always and In All Ways.</strong></li>\r\n	<br />\r\n	<li>By simply and profoundly giving Love to yourself everyday in every way you are saying to the Universe you are worthy of attaining any dream, vision or goal. Immediately drop any neediness for love, acceptance and approval from others and replace it with self-love. Step aside from everyone&#39;s judgments of you and use that crucial time and energy to send yourself loving and appreciative thoughts. You will increase your manifesting ability and power with every loving feeling you have about yourself that is usually negative and skeptical. The greatest manifesting energy comes from within this Infinite Source of Thought of your being which is in essence Absolute Love.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	In simple words, anchor in your belief in your own power to manifest by celebrating your success. The more you do this, the easier it becomes to find exactly what you want in life. Have a glass of champagne. Go out for dinner. Splash out. It is important to honor your victories. Angels tread lightly. You are an angel. Lighten up, have fun with life, and watch your desires come to pass with ever increasing rapidity. Make it so!&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 'How To Manifest Everything That You Want', 1, 1, '0'),

Productivity as a concept does not only mean being &quot;productive at work&quot; but also being productive in other areas of our life. On a wider scale, it means &quot;being productive as a person&quot;.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhatever we&#39;ve accomplished in the past are just that - part of our past. But they should serve us as a starting point for another milestone. The past is as important as the future. We can only move forward to the future if we let the past gauge what we&#39;ve accomplished against what should have been accomplished. There is always a room for improvement.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Family</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is one of the reasons why we aspire for greater productivity. We want to become efficient in all areas of our job so we can have more free time to spend with our family. We want to minimize our stress level at work so that, we still have the zest for anything waiting for us at home. Looking back, have you spent enough time with your loved ones? Have you taken good care of your relationships with friends, relatives, spouse, kids, partner, and someone special?&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Faith</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat motivates you aside from family and personal goals? It is important that we believe in some higher form of principles. Some people believe in higher entities that are beyond us. Our morals and values are oftentimes tied with what we believe in. People have their sense of responsibility aligned with universal principles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Career</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the bigger picture, career is only a small portion of what we all are here for. For some, career is the most important part of their lives. Then there are some people for whom, career is important only because they consider it as a channel through which they achieve certain needs. If it is a channel for the attainment of the things that matter to us, then we need to improve it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Finance</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur daily subsistence is not only determined by our ability to adapt ourselves to our environment but also by the amount of money we&#39;re capable to spend. We should set some goals to improve our financial standing. Cost-cutting and money-saving are the most obvious things that we can do right away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are only some of the areas that we need to consider in order for us to have a crystal clear view of what we need to improve on to achieve a higher level of productivity. Some of us have already completed the goals - things that they want to have or to be in the next few years. At some point, we need to have the goals that are necessary for us to improve ourselves and the people around us. These goals should be put to realization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe need to have plans on how to achieve the goals. And we should put on top of our list the things that really matter. These goals can only have their meaning if we use them to build the blueprint upon which our actual plans are drawn. And these plans are only figment of our imagination until they are put into action. As said by the wise men, &quot;All of life is a journey which paths we take, what we look back on, and what we look forward to is up to us. We determine our destination, what kind of road we will take to get there, and how happy we are when we get there.&quot; So, before making a plunge to the future, look back to see what you&#39;ve achieved and how far you have to achieve.</p>\r\n', 'Look Back to Look Forward', 0, 1, '0'),
